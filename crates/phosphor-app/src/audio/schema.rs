//! Single source of truth for the audio feature-vector layout and per-feature
//! processing policies.
//!
//! [`AudioFeatures`](super::features::AudioFeatures) is a `#[repr(C)]` POD that
//! is cast to `[f32; NUM_FEATURES]`. Several stages treat that slice
//! *positionally* — the adaptive normalizer decides which features to pass
//! through, the smoother picks attack/release constants per slot, and the
//! stale-feature decay exempts the tempo estimate. Historically each of those
//! sites hardcoded its own index literals (`15..=19`, `BPM_INDEX = 18`, a
//! hand-ordered 46-entry table), so inserting a feature anywhere shifted the
//! indices out from under them and silently corrupted the wrong channels.
//!
//! [`FEATURES`] is the one ordered table those stages read from. Its order MUST
//! match the field order of `AudioFeatures`; the `schema_matches_struct_layout`
//! test pins the boundary fields so a reorder or a missed row fails the build's
//! test run, and a `const` assertion pins the length.
