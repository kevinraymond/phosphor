//! A8 (#1459): render-rate interpolation of the audio feature vector.
//!
//! Analysis runs at a fixed 86.1 Hz hop ([`ANALYSIS_HOP`](super::ANALYSIS_HOP) @ 44.1 kHz)
//! while the render loop polls at the display's refresh rate. On a 144 Hz panel that means
//! ~28% of polls see a byte-identical frame: continuous features go slightly flat, and the
//! two sawtooths — `beat_phase` and `bar_phase`, which only move when a frame lands —
//! visibly stair-step. A dropped frame (the channel is `bounded(4)`, drop-on-full) shows up
//! as a phase pop.
//!
//! This module keeps a short ring of timestamped frames and a playhead running
//! [`TARGET_DELAY_HOPS`] behind the audio sample clock, blends the two frames bracketing
//! it per each slot's [`InterpPolicy`], and advances both sawtooths locally as first-order
//! PLLs locked to the audio thread's phases (A8 #1459 for `beat_phase`, A8b #1554 for
//! `bar_phase`) — see [`advance_phase`].
