# Contributing to Fosfora

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Fosfora is a live VJ engine built with Rust, wgpu, and WGSL shaders. Whether you're adding effects, fixing bugs, or improving docs, contributions are welcome.

## Building

**Prerequisites:**
- Rust 1.97+ (pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`; install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs))
- Audio input device (built-in mic works)
- Vulkan-capable GPU

**Setup:**
```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks   # enable pre-commit checks (fmt + clippy)
```

**Commands:**
```bash
cargo run --release              # release build (recommended)
cargo run                        # debug build (slower shaders)
RUST_LOG=phosphor_app=debug cargo run  # verbose logging
```

## Adding an Effect

The fastest way to contribute is writing a new visual effect. Three steps:

1. **Create a shader** in `assets/shaders/your_effect.wgsl`. Start from the template in [docs/TECHNICAL.md](docs/TECHNICAL.md#shader-authoring-guide) — you get time, resolution, 74 audio features, up to 16 params, and a WGSL library (noise, palette, SDF, tonemap) auto-prepended.

2. **Create a definition** in `assets/effects/your_effect.pfx` (JSON):
   ```json
   {
       "name": "Your Effect",
       "author": "You",
       "description": "What it looks like",
       "shader": "your_effect.wgsl",
       "inputs": [
           { "type": "Float", "name": "speed", "default": 0.5, "min": 0.0, "max": 1.0 }
       ]
   }
   ```

3. **Run** — the effect appears in the browser automatically. Edit the shader while running; it hot-reloads on save.

See the [Shader Authoring Guide](docs/TECHNICAL.md#shader-authoring-guide) for uniforms, multi-pass, particles, feedback, and common pitfalls.

## Reporting Bugs

Please include:
- OS and GPU (e.g., "Linux, NVIDIA RTX 4090")
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Log output if relevant (`RUST_LOG=phosphor_app=debug cargo run`)

## Code Style

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Keep `cargo clippy` clean
- No new `unsafe` without justification
- Prefer dedicated wgpu abstractions over raw API calls

The pre-commit hook and the CI `lint` job run clippy on the **host** target only, so
`#[cfg(target_os = "…")]` code for other platforms is not linted locally. CI's `build`
matrix runs clippy per native target to cover it. If you touch Windows/macOS-gated code,
lint it yourself by cross-compiling clippy (targets install via `rustup target add`):

```sh
cargo clippy --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu -- -D warnings   # Windows-gated code
cargo clippy --target aarch64-apple-darwin  -- -D warnings   # macOS-gated code
```

## Pull Requests

- One feature or fix per PR
- Test on at least one platform before submitting
- Include a brief description of what changed and why
- New effects should include both the `.wgsl` shader and `.pfx` definition
