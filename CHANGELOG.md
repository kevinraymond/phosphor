## Unreleased

### Added
- **Audio panel STRUCTURE readout + OSC Broadcast-TX toggle** — the audio monitor panel gains a **STRUCTURE** section showing the A10/A18 features live: short-term loudness, loudness trend, build-up, section novelty (bars), and a **drop** indicator that flashes on the pulse — so the new detectors are visible without an external OSC monitor. Also fixes an OSC-panel gap: TX broadcast had Host/Port/Rate fields but **no enable toggle** (the "Enable OSC" checkbox is RX-only), so `tx_enabled` could only be set by editing `osc.json`; added a **Broadcast TX** checkbox wired to the existing `set_tx_enabled`.
- **Build-up / drop / section-boundary detection (A18)** — the engine finally sees structure *beyond a single beat*: the drop and section changes no longer have to be hand-triggered. Fills the three reserved `section_novelty` / `buildup` / `drop` slots with **zero shader-ABI/layout change** (DSP + policy only, per finding #1492). New `audio/structure.rs` runs a cheap ~10 Hz stage (decimated from the 86 Hz analysis frame rate) on the **pre-normalization** features (the adaptive normalizer would flatten exactly the loudness/sub-bass dynamics it keys on): **`section_novelty`** is a **Foote** self-similarity novelty — each tick appends a compact unit-normalized timbre vector (7 bands + MFCC 1–8) to a 60 s ring, and a Gaussian-tapered **checkerboard kernel** slid along the self-similarity diagonal peaks where the block structure changes (causal, so a boundary is reported ~3 s after it happens). **`buildup`** is a logistic blend of loudness rise (A10 `loudness_trend`), spectral brightening (centroid rise), onset-density rise (A6 onset stream), and sub-bass **withdrawal** (the classic EDM pre-drop high-pass sweep) — a global-intensity driver for auto camera push-in / tension. **`drop`** is a 1-frame pulse that fires when `buildup` has been sustained high (≥4 s) and then a broadband loudness jump (≥~5 LU) lands together with the sub-bass returning, with a 16 s refractory; it is **counter-latched** by the audio thread (like `beat`/`downbeat`, via a new `drop_counter` atomic) so the pulse survives channel overflow and the drain-to-newest poll. The three fields are detector-owned (`section_novelty`/`buildup` pass through the normalizer and are lightly smoothed to iron out the 10 Hz decimation stairs; `drop` bypasses the smoother and ForceZeros on silence) and broadcast over OSC TX (`/phosphor/audio/{section_novelty,buildup,drop}`). Thresholds/weights are documented module consts; a user-facing tuning UI is a separate follow-up. Heuristics tuned for electronic music. Depends on A10 (loudness) and A6 (onset). Unlocks auto scene-switch/flash on the drop and structure-aware dramaturgy (flagship: Movements, V14 #1488). (board #1469)
- **EBU R128 / BS.1770 loudness (A10)** — fills the three reserved `loudness_m` / `loudness_s` / `loudness_trend` slots #1505 reserved with **zero shader-ABI/layout change** (DSP + policy only, per finding #1492). New `audio/loudness.rs` K-weights the capture stream through the two-stage BS.1770 pre-filter (a ~+4 dB high-shelf above ~1.68 kHz and a ~38 Hz high-pass, with coefficients **re-derived for the actual device sample rate** since Phosphor has no resampler), then integrates the K-weighted mean square over sliding **400 ms (momentary)** and **3 s (short-term)** windows via per-sample running sums; `LUFS = -0.691 + 10·log10(ms)`, mapped −60..0 LUFS → 0..1. `loudness_trend` is the rising component of `M − S` (in LU) — a ready-made build/drop hint consumed by A18 (#1469). The three fields are detector-owned: they **pass through** the adaptive normalizer (percentile rescaling would destroy the perceptual, device-independent scale) and Scale toward 0 on silence. A perceptual **silence gate** (momentary < −55 LUFS) is exposed for the onset detector to adopt (A6 #1457). Broadcast over OSC TX (`/phosphor/audio/{loudness_m,loudness_s,loudness_trend}`). Foundation for structure detection (A18) and a unified silence gate across the audio stages. (board #1461)
- **Downbeat / bar-phase / meter tracking (A12)** — fills the three `downbeat` / `bar_phase` / `beat_in_bar` slots #1505 reserved with **zero shader-ABI/layout change** (DSP + policy only, per finding #1492). New `audio/downbeat.rs` sits after beat detection: at each scheduled beat it snapshots a small "beat-level vector" — per-band spectral flux integrated since the previous beat (a new read-only `Analyzer::band_flux_3()` that reuses the kick detector's `spectral_flux_range` for low/mid/high, so it doesn't disturb the kick flux state), the loudness rise, and the **chroma-change magnitude** taken from the pre-normalization chroma (chord changes correlate with downbeats) — into a ring of the last 16 beats. It scores each candidate meter M ∈ {3, 4} and bar phase p by how much more "downbeat-like" the beats at phase p are than the rest (accent contrast), locks the winner with ~8-beat hysteresis, and falls back to 4/4 aligned to the strongest recent beat when confidence is low. `downbeat` fires on the bar's "one" (counter-latched like `beat` so the 1-frame pulse survives channel overflow), `bar_phase` is a 0→1 sawtooth advanced on the audio clock between beats (like `beat_phase`), and `beat_in_bar` is the normalized beat index. The three fields are detector-owned (pass through the normalizer; `downbeat` bypasses the smoother and ForceZeros on silence, `bar_phase`/`beat_in_bar` bypass and Scale) and are broadcast over OSC TX (`/phosphor/audio/{downbeat,bar_phase,beat_in_bar}`). DSP downbeat tracking is ~70-80% accurate on 4/4 electronic music; the outputs are the same fields a future neural tracker (A20) can drive. Unlocks bar-synced visuals (flagship: Cadence, #1480). (board #1463)
- **Musical key detection + true constant-Q chroma (tuning-compensated)** — fills the three `key_*` slots #1505 reserved (`key_class`, `key_is_minor`, `key_confidence`) with **zero shader-ABI/layout change** (DSP + policy only, per finding #1492). Two new audio modules: `audio/chroma.rs` replaces the old FFT-bin → pitch-class histogram (which hard-rounded every bin to the nearest of 12 classes) with a **CQT-lite** chromagram — sparse per-semitone log-frequency Gaussian kernels (MIDI 36–96, ~0.5-semitone bandwidth) over the 4096-pt spectrum, octave-folded and harmonically summed (1/h weighting so a note is reinforced by its own resolvable upper harmonics) — plus a slow **tuning estimator** that tracks the global A-reference (±50 cents) from parabola-refined spectral peaks and shifts the kernel centres, so a 432 Hz-tuned track no longer smears across pitch classes. `audio/key.rs` maintains a ~12 s rolling chroma mean and Pearson-correlates it against the 24 Krumhansl-Kessler major/minor profiles, with hysteresis (a challenger must beat the incumbent by a margin for >3 s) so the detected key doesn't flicker between relatives. The three fields are detector-owned: they pass through the adaptive normalizer, `key_class`/`key_is_minor` bypass the smoother and **Hold** on silence (no sweep toward C) while `key_confidence` **Scales** toward 0. The audio panel's chroma wheel is now genuinely constant-Q (the "Constant-Q chromagram" tooltip was previously false) and gains a **key readout** (e.g. `C maj · 82%`, or `—` when confidence is low), and the key is broadcast over OSC TX (`/phosphor/audio/key/{class,is_minor,confidence}`). Unlocks key-locked palettes app-wide (Chromatica, #1477). (board #1462)
- **Strata — spectral-canyon effect** — a heightfield raymarcher flown over the A17 `spectrogram()` mel-history: the last ~8 s of audio *is* the terrain (loud = ridges, quiet = chasms), lateral position = frequency band, with the **newest audio erupting nearest the camera** and ageing into the distance ("a chasm opening beneath"). Built on proper terrain-raymarch technique (board #1508, refining the #1479 first pass): distance-capped adaptive march with a `t·eps` hit tolerance + bisection refine (no overstep/tunnel shards), analytic pixel-footprint LOD, **Catmull-Rom** interpolation across the coarse 64-band mel axis, footprint-scaled normals, iq **soft raymarched shadows**, aerial-perspective sun-tinted **height fog**, and height/slope **materials** (slope rock, sedimentary strata banding, per-ridge snow caps that follow loudness). A **continuous sub-texel scroll** (`scroll_phase`, repurposed from the reserved `_pad_align` uniform pad — no layout change) plus a per-band ingest EMA smooth the terrain in motion; a **two-sided world-edge envelope** keeps a loud newest ridge from engulfing the camera and prevents the far ClampToEdge "monolith". Six params: height, draw distance (fog), camera pitch, rock detail, snow line, and **zoom** (pull up for an overview). Audio: `rolloff` → draw distance, `flatness` → specular gloss, `beat`/`kick` → ridge glow + specular, `centroid` → subtle warmth. The first consumer of `spectrogram()` and `u.rolloff`. (board #1479, #1508)
- **Beam — vector-CRT oscilloscope effect** — the first effect to draw the audio signal itself, and the first consumer of the A17 `waveform()` texture (and of `u.zcr`). A fragment pass integrates Gaussian beam energy along the min/max waveform polyline using a new 2D segment SDF (`phosphor_sd_segment2` in `lib/sdf.wgsl`), dwell-weighting each segment by the inverse of its screen length for the signature bright-slow / dim-fast CRT look, rendered into a feedback pass whose slow decay is the phosphor persistence. Two modes (`mode` param): **scope** (horizontal sweep, min/max envelope + soft fill) and **radial** (waveform wrapped on a circle whose base radius grows with `rms`). Audio: `rms` → beam intensity, `centroid` → colour temperature (house warm→cool palette), `zcr` → beam focus/defocus, `beat` → persistence kick, `onset` → flash. The waveform is already zero-crossing-triggered CPU-side (A17) so the trace holds still. Lissajous mode is deferred until stereo capture lands (A13, #1464). (board #1476)
- **A17 audio textures now live — waveform / spectrum / scrolling mel-spectrogram** — the three audio textures that #1505 reserved as 1×1 placeholders now carry real data, filling bindings 3/4/5 (+ sampler 6) with **zero shader-ABI/layout/template change** (DSP/upload only, per finding #1492). `waveform(x)` reads a zero-crossing-triggered min/max-decimated PCM window (`Rg16Float` 1024×1, peeked render-side from the recording ring via a new non-consuming `RingBuffer::peek_latest` — no audio-thread change); `spectrum(x)` reads a log-frequency magnitude spectrum (`R16Float` 512×1); and `spectrogram(uv)` reads a scrolling 64-band mel history (`R16Float` 512×64 — bumped from `R8Unorm` during Strata #1508 to kill 8-bit height terracing, per-band EMA-smoothed at ingest; uv.x = time oldest→newest, uv.y = mel). The audio thread computes the spectrum + mel column from the existing multi-resolution FFT (a dedicated 64-band mel filterbank, leaving the MFCC 26-band bank untouched) and ships them alongside `AudioFeatures` on the existing channel; the render thread uploads all three each frame. Because the frozen ABI has no `spectrogram_head` uniform, the spectrogram is kept in linear time order and re-uploaded rather than addressed circularly. Unlocks oscilloscopes, spectrum bars and waterfalls (flagship effects Beam #1476 / Strata #1479). (board #1468)
- **Batched shader-ABI bump — reserved audio-feature layout + A17 audio textures (v2 shader ABI)** — one coordinated ABI change that reserves every slot the upcoming audio detectors need, so the DSP can land later filling `0.0` placeholders with **zero further shader-ABI churn** (the pattern #1474 used for padding). This is deliberately batched into a single template version because every ABI change invalidates compiled user shaders (board #1492). `AudioFeatures` grows 46 → **61** features (184 → 244 bytes) and `ShaderUniforms` grows 288 → **352 bytes**, both by appending a 15-scalar reserved tail so existing field offsets are untouched: `loudness_m/loudness_s/loudness_trend` (A10 #1461), `key_class/key_is_minor/key_confidence` (A11 #1462), `downbeat/bar_phase/beat_in_bar` (A12 #1463), `pan/stereo_width/stereo_corr` (A13 #1464), `section_novelty/buildup/drop` (A18 #1469). The WGSL `PhosphorUniforms` preamble and `default.wgsl` mirror the new fields, and `bar_phase` is forwarded into `ParticleUniforms` (consuming one spare pad slot — still 832 bytes). Also lands the **A17** render bind-group extension (#1468): bindings 3/4/5 for `waveform` / `spectrum` / `spectrogram` textures + a shared sampler (binding 6), with `waveform(x)` / `spectrum(x)` / `spectrogram(uv)` shader helpers. All new scalars read `0.0` until their detectors ship (the three audio textures are 1×1 placeholders here, filled by the A17 DSP follow-up above); effects can bind everything today and light up automatically. (board #1505, #1504)
- **Particle shaders gain 5 more audio features** — `flatness`, `rolloff`, `bandwidth`, `bpm`, and `beat_strength` are now forwarded into `ParticleUniforms` (and mirrored in `particle_lib.wgsl`), filling previously reserved padding with zero layout change (still 832 bytes). Compute/particle shaders can now react to spectral shape and tempo strength, matching what fragment shaders already receive. (board #1474)
- **Community health files** — added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant v2.1), `SECURITY.md` (private disclosure via GitHub security advisories), and a `.github/pull_request_template.md`, completing GitHub's recommended community standards checklist.

### Changed
- **Spectral feature correctness pass — centroid / flux / flatness / rolloff (A4)** — the four spectral-shape features were each subtly wrong. **Centroid** was magnitude-weighted on a linear-Hz axis and included the DC bin, so it lived in the top octave and was unstable near silence; it is now a **power-weighted mean of log2(frequency)** (skipping DC) mapped to 0..1 over a musical 40 Hz–18 kHz range — a usable brightness fader, held steady below the silence gate by its FixedRange policy (A2). **Flux** was an unnormalized linear-magnitude sum over the whole spectrum, so it doubled when the volume doubled (a second RMS); it is now a **level-invariant** per-bin log-magnitude half-wave difference averaged over bins (with a −60 dB floor so noise-floor bins, where per-bin log is wildly unstable, don't dominate), so it measures *change* not level and the Adaptive percentile policy ranges it. **Flatness** skipped tiny bins from both means (biased up in sparse spectra) and was dominated by the dense HF region; it is now **Wiener entropy over the 26 mel bands** (reusing the MFCC filterbank, every band counted), cleanly separating tonal pads (low) from noise sweeps (high). **Rolloff** now skips DC and its 85% is a named const (`ROLLOFF_PERCENTILE`) instead of a magic number. The six spectral-shape features (`centroid` / `flux` / `flatness` / `rolloff` / `bandwidth` / `zcr`) are now also **broadcast over OSC TX** (`/phosphor/audio/*`) — previously only `kick` among them was emitted, so they were unreachable to external tooling and unverifiable end-to-end. No shader-ABI change. (board #1455)
- **Kick detection — single detector-owned normalizer (A3)** — `kick` was **double-AGC'd**: the analyzer normalized a *linear*-magnitude 30–120 Hz flux by a peak-hold `kick_max` (0.999/frame ≈ 10 s hold), and then — because slot 8 was `Adaptive` — the feature normalizer stretched it a *second* time, so the kick was nearly always saturated on quiet material and its scale depended on two interacting auto-levelers. It is now computed **once**: a **log-magnitude** half-wave flux (the same level-invariant form as the SuperFlux onset detector, so a bass *change* registers regardless of absolute level) normalized by its **own long-term P95** (`FftAnalyzer::kick_envelope`, reusing the A2 `PercentileWindow`), and marked **Passthrough** in the schema so the feature normalizer no longer touches it. The envelope is **gated on the A10 perceptual silence flag** (momentary < −55 LUFS) and skips its window push during silence, so log-flux of the noise floor can't manufacture kicks and the P95 is frozen for the next active passage — a kick after a quiet break isn't over-scaled. The 30–120 Hz magnitudes are also **floored (−60 dB) before the log**, so the near-silent low bins under a bassless lead or a high sweep read a constant zero instead of jittering into false kicks (verified end-to-end: a pure 1 kHz/440 Hz tone and a 200→8 kHz sweep now read kick ≈ 0, while a real kick and broadband noise still fire). Result: kick-bound strobes stop firing on hi-hat bleed, bassless leads, and quiet passages, and no longer saturate on loud sustained bass. Deleted the dead `kick_max` / `prev_kick_flux` analyzer state; no shader-ABI change; the optional binary `kick_pulse` is deferred to the next batched ABI bump (decision #1504). (board #1454)
- **Gated percentile normalization + per-feature policies (A2)** — the adaptive normalizer was a single symmetric running-min/max with one global decay applied to *every* feature, which (a) stretched quiet-room noise to full scale so visuals danced to silence, (b) let one transient spike squash everything for ~2 s while the max decayed (pumping), and (c) gave signed MFCCs and already-max-normed chroma the same min/max treatment as energy bands. Replaced `AdaptiveNormalizer` with a **`FeatureNormalizer`** that dispatches on a per-slot `NormPolicy` (extended with `FixedRange` and `ZScore`): **Adaptive** (bands / rms / flux) is now **gated percentile ranging** — `(v − P5) / (P95 − P5)` over a ~4 s windowed history with a soft knee above P95, so one outlier no longer defines the top of the range and the window length *is* the spike-recovery time (the old "decay after spike" heuristic is gone); on the **A10 perceptual silence gate** (momentary < −55 LUFS) energy features read 0 with the window **frozen**, so a quiet room can't be auto-ranged up. **FixedRange** (centroid / flatness / rolloff / bandwidth / zcr — features A4 puts in a known 0..1 range) clamps and **holds its last value** through silence instead of dancing. **ZScore** (the 13 signed MFCCs) standardizes each coefficient by a running mean/variance and maps ±3σ → 0..1 through tanh, so excursions read symmetrically about 0.5. **Chroma + dominant_chroma** move to Passthrough (the CQT already max-norms them). New `audio/ranging.rs` holds the shared windowed-percentile primitive (also reused by the A3 kick). Clean replacement — no A/B setting, no shader-ABI change. (board #1453)
- **Unified band scaling — all seven bands in one dB domain (A1)** — the 7 frequency bands were computed in **two incompatible families**: `sub_bass`/`bass`/`low_mid`/`mid` as linear RMS magnitude and `upper_mid`/`presence`/`brilliance` as dB(−80..0), so a visual bound to `band.0` and one bound to `band.5` behaved like different species and the adaptive normalizer saw wildly different input dynamics. A new **`band_scale`** setting (`Unified dB` default, `Legacy` opt-out) puts all seven bands in one **dB(−60..0)** domain with a **+3 dB/oct equal-loudness tilt above 2 kHz**, so the bands are directly comparable (each keeps the FFT resolution best suited to its range). This sharpens everything downstream that reads the bands — the normalizer, A18's timbre vector and sub-bass-withdrawal logic, A6's partitions. **`Legacy` reproduces the exact pre-A1 behavior** for presets tuned to the old feel; the setting lives in `settings.json` and a **Settings → Band Scale** dropdown that applies live (rebuilds the capture pipeline). Deferred to a follow-up (#1452 part b): exposing 32 mel bands as `audio.melband.0..31` binding sources. No shader-ABI change. (board #1452)
- **SuperFlux onset detection — closes the 250–500 Hz snare gap (A6)** — the onset stage was a weighted spectral flux over four fixed bands (20–80, 80–250, 500–2000, 2000–4000 Hz) with a **hole at 250–500 Hz** (snare bodies, toms, male vocals) that also false-triggered on vibrato and pitch slides. It is now **SuperFlux** (Böck & Widmer, DAFx 2013): a 64-band contiguous log-magnitude filterbank flux (built on the 4096-pt spectrum) whose reference frame is passed through a **frequency maximum filter** (±1 band), so a partial can drift slightly between frames without registering an onset — killing the phantom onsets on wobble synths and vibrato — while the contiguous bands cover the old snare gap. The bands are grouped into low/mid/high partitions whose mean flux is weighted (0.60/0.28/0.12) to preserve the previous kick/snare/hat balance, and the existing median + 2·MAD adaptive threshold + ceiling logic and onset-strength normalization are unchanged, so beat/tempo tracking downstream is undisturbed (all BPM-convergence tests still pass). The detector now shares the **A10 perceptual silence gate** (momentary < −55 LUFS) instead of a raw-RMS threshold, so silence is judged the same way across devices and content. Relies on the fixed hop (A5) for a well-defined frame-to-frame max filter. (board #1457)
- **Deterministic fixed 512-sample analysis hop (A5)** — the audio thread previously slept 10 ms and analyzed whatever samples had arrived (an effective hop of ~441 samples ± scheduler jitter that grew under load), so spectral-flux/onset amplitudes varied with hop size and the tempo estimator had to guess its own frame rate from wall-clock timestamps. It now accumulates capture reads into a FIFO and runs one analyze→normalize→beat→downbeat→smooth frame per **exactly `ANALYSIS_HOP` (512) samples**, looping when a read yields several hops (e.g. catching up after a stall). Frame rate is now exactly `sr / 512` (≈86.1 Hz @ 44.1 kHz), passed to `BeatDetector::new`, so the tempo estimator's **runtime frame-rate re-estimation is deleted** (it existed only to compensate for the jittery hop). Frames are timestamped from a **sample clock** (`samples_consumed / sr`) instead of `Instant::now()`, so timing is exact even when a burst of hops is processed in one wakeup. The 4096-sample analysis window's 87.5% overlap is unchanged; all beat/tempo tests pass. Prerequisite for SuperFlux onset (A6, whose time max-filter needs a fixed hop) and clean ~10 Hz decimation in structure detection (A18); also feeds sample-clock timestamps to A8. (board #1456)
- **Audio feature schema (single source of truth)** — added `audio/schema.rs` with an ordered `FEATURES` table that owns each feature's normalization, smoothing, and stale-decay policy. The adaptive normalizer (passthrough set), the attack/release smoother (previously a hand-ordered 46-entry table), and the stale-feature decay (previously a `BPM_INDEX = 18` literal + a special-cased `beat = 0`) now all read their per-feature policy from that table instead of hardcoding positional indices, so adding a feature no longer risks silently shifting indices out from under those stages. A `const` length assertion plus a layout-guard test pin the table to the `#[repr(C)]` struct order. Behavior is unchanged (all existing normalizer/smoother/decay tests pass). Prerequisite for the batched audio-feature additions ahead. (board #1451)

### Fixed
- **Stale/foreign pipeline cache no longer aborts startup** — a `pipeline_cache.bin` written by a different GPU/driver (GPU swap, hybrid graphics, eGPU, or a driver update) is now discarded and rebuilt instead of fatally failing app init. In wgpu 27, `create_pipeline_cache(fallback: true)` does **not** quietly return an empty cache on a device mismatch — it returns an *invalid* cache object that then makes the first `create_render_pipeline` fail ("Failed to initialize app", black-on-launch). The loaded blob is now validated under a validation error scope; if wgpu rejects it (typically "cache data was created for a different device"), the stale file is deleted and an empty valid cache is created, which the next run repopulates. Verified end-to-end by loading an RTX-written cache under lavapipe (recovers with a warn) and confirming a matching cache still loads clean. (board #1507)

### Changed (docs)
- **ELI5 README + TUTORIALS pass** — rewrote the README for newcomers (plain "What is this?", a 3-step Quick Start with first-10-seconds expectations, a "Make it yours" analogy section, and an FAQ/Troubleshooting section covering audio-input selection, black screen/GPU, and macOS notarization), and embedded a hero clip (`assets/fosfora-teaser.gif`, renamed from `phosphor-teaser.gif`; placeholder for a fresh capture). Fixed the README effects list (was 8 of the old set) and the TUTORIALS effects table (listed 4 non-existent effects — Swarm/Veil/Nova/Vortex) to the real **24 built-in effects (22 browsable + 2 hidden)**, split into shader vs particle. Corrected the keyboard table (added `Space`/`T` timeline keys, clarified `Esc`), the build prerequisite (Rust 1.90+ → 1.97+), the bundled preset list (added Spectral Eye), and the TUTORIALS audio band ranges (`sub_bass` 20–60 Hz, `bass` 60–250 Hz) and shader-uniform reference (now shows the `mfcc(i)` / `chroma_val(i)` helpers so the "46 audio features in shaders" claim is self-consistent). Config-path and OSC-namespace sections were intentionally left on their current `~/.config/phosphor/` / `/phosphor/*` values, to be swept with the pending rename Phase 2.

## v1.8.0 — 2026-07-15

### Changed
- **Rebranded to Fosfora** — the project, app, window title, NDI source name, macOS bundle, release binaries (`fosfora` / `Fosfora.app`), and documentation are now "Fosfora" (Northern Sami for phosphorus). The signature **Phosphor** effect keeps its name as a heritage nod. Two runtime surfaces are intentionally unchanged this release to avoid breaking existing setups and will migrate later: the config directory (`~/.config/phosphor/`) and the OSC namespace (`/phosphor/*`), along with the Python `bridges/` tooling that targets it. The macOS bundle identifier (`com.kevinraymond.phosphor`) is also unchanged so existing microphone permissions are preserved.

### Fixed (docs)
- **Doc accuracy** — corrected the built-in effect count (23 → 24) and removed the non-existent "Swarm" effect from the README table; corrected the audio-feature count (20 → 46) in the README and tutorials; de-duplicated the AI-assist disclaimer in the README "Note from Dev"; fixed the `.pfx` `passes[].feedback` default in TECHNICAL.md (documented as `false`, actually `true`).

### Security
- **Dependency advisories** — bumped `anyhow` 1.0.102 → 1.0.103 (RUSTSEC-2026-0190, unsound `Error::downcast_mut`) and updated `wayland-scanner`/`uds_windows` patch versions; added documented deny.toml ignores for quick-xml RUSTSEC-2026-0194/0195 (DoS via untrusted XML — only reachable through `wayland-scanner`, a build-time proc-macro parsing trusted bundled protocol XML; remove once the Wayland stack allows quick-xml ≥ 0.41)
- **Dependency advisories** — bumped `rustls-webpki` 0.103.9 → 0.103.13 (RUSTSEC-2026-0049, RUSTSEC-2026-0098) and `tar` 0.4.44 → 0.4.46 (RUSTSEC-2026-0067, RUSTSEC-2026-0068) to clear the cargo-deny audit

### Fixed
- **Multi-pass feedback default** — `passes[].feedback` now defaults to `true`, matching legacy single-shader behavior, so converting an effect from `shader:` to `passes:` no longer silently disables feedback (set `"feedback": false` explicitly to opt out; all built-in effects set it explicitly and are unaffected)
- **Beat pulses no longer dropped** — beats are latched via an atomic counter so 1-frame beat triggers survive channel overflow and multi-frame drains; burst-on-beat effects fire on every beat even under load
- **Visuals settle on audio stall** — held audio features now decay to silence in ~1s instead of freezing at the last loud frame when the device stops delivering data (BPM readout preserved); a watchdog surfaces a status toast once per stall episode (detection only — no auto-reconnect, which could hang on a capture thread blocked in a timeout-less read; on Windows a >10s playback pause may trigger the toast since WASAPI loopback delivers no packets during silence)
- **Normalizer field pass-through** — all beat-detector-owned features (onset, beat, beat_phase, bpm, beat_strength) now bypass adaptive normalization; an off-by-one index range previously misclassified onset and beat
- **Recording A/V sync** — audio recording now starts from the moment recording begins instead of draining minutes of stale ring-buffer history into the encoder; ring-buffer reads are also clamped to capacity so a lapped consumer recovers with the newest window
- **Save errors surfaced** — effect saves (particle definition and debounced parameter saves) and recording-start failures now show a status-bar error toast instead of failing silently; a failed parameter save no longer marks the shader editor's paired `.pfx` as clean
- **Clippy warnings** — cleared 13 default-feature clippy lints (collapsible match guards in `app.rs`/`main.rs`/`web/state.rs`, derivable `Default` for `ParticleQuality`, redundant `String` clones in UI panels)
- **Depth feature** — `depth` feature now depends on `webcam` (depth estimation requires webcam input), eliminating dead-code warnings when building with `--features depth` alone
- **Windows CI warnings** — removed unused import, allowed dead code on `wasapi_available()`, fixed unreachable expression in `create_audio_fifo()`, fixed function pointer cast in midir patch
- **Cross-target clippy debt** — fixed a Windows-only `ptr_as_ptr`/`ptr_cast_constness` violation in `wasapi_capture.rs` and a `webcam`/`depth`-feature `implicit_clone` in `webcam.rs`, both previously invisible to the host-only clippy runs (board #1500)

### Added
- **Pre-commit hook** — `.githooks/pre-commit` runs `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy -D warnings`
- **Reduced-motion detection (macOS/Windows)** — implemented the platform detection that was previously stubbed to always return `false`: macOS via `NSWorkspace.accessibilityDisplayShouldReduceMotion` (objc2-app-kit), Windows via `SystemParametersInfoW(SPI_GETCLIENTAREAANIMATION)`. Linux (gsettings) already worked. This is the detection backend only — `ReducedMotion` is not yet consumed by any effect/animation, so there is no user-visible behavior change until it is wired in

### Changed
- **CI lints cfg-gated platform code** — the cross-OS `build` matrix now runs `cargo clippy -D warnings` per native target (Linux/macOS/Windows), so `#[cfg(target_os = …)]` code that host-only clippy never compiled is finally linted; the Linux `lint` job now denies warnings too (matching the pre-commit hook). The pre-commit hook stays host-only for fast commits — see CONTRIBUTING.md for the manual cross-target command. (board #1500)
- **README** — expanded build-from-source section with per-feature prerequisites; added Binding Matrix section and `B` keyboard shortcut
- **NDI docs** — clarified that NDI output is built into official release downloads (only the NDI runtime needs installing); the `--features ndi` flag now framed as a from-source-only step in README and TUTORIALS

### Documentation
- **Stale-docs sweep** — corrected the `AudioFeatures` doc comment (45 → 46 features) and renamed the byte-size test to match its 184-byte assertion; fixed the audio-panel footer to report the real multi-resolution FFT sizes (`4096/1024/512` rather than a bare `512`)

## v1.7.1 — 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **Binding matrix button** — clicking the "Matrix" button in the left panel now correctly opens the binding matrix (previously opened for one frame then immediately closed due to same-frame click-outside detection)
- **Status bar hint** — added `B binding matrix` keyboard hint to the status bar

### Added
- **Cargo.toml metadata** — added `description`, `repository`, `readme`, `publish` fields to member crate
- **CI format check** — added `cargo fmt --all -- --check` job to CI workflow
- **Dependency auditing** — added `deny.toml` and `cargo-deny` CI job for license compliance and vulnerability scanning
- **Direct video recording** — record Phosphor output directly to MP4/MKV via FFmpeg subprocess with NVENC hardware encoding (auto-fallback to CPU encoders). Supports H.264, HEVC, and AV1 codecs up to 8K resolution at 30/60 FPS with configurable CQ quality. Includes audio capture from the active audio input (muxed as AAC via named FIFO). Recording runs independently alongside NDI output. New "Outputs" subsection in Settings panel with record button, codec/resolution/FPS/quality/audio controls, and live status display (duration, file size, encoder info). No new crate dependencies — uses the same subprocess pattern as the FFmpeg webcam backend.
- **Shared FrameCapture** — extracted double-buffered GPU readback from `NdiCapture` into `gpu::frame_capture::FrameCapture`, reused by both NDI and recording systems
- **OutputResolution::Res8K** — 7680x4320 output resolution option for both NDI and recording
- **OutputResolution moved to `gpu::types`** — shared by NDI and recording modules (NDI re-exports for backwards compatibility)

### Changed
- **Background shader compilation** — shader hot-reload (fragment + compute) now compiles on a dedicated background thread instead of blocking the main render loop. Eliminates 50-500ms frame hitches when saving `.wgsl` files during development. Old pipeline continues rendering while the new one compiles; swap is atomic on completion.
- **Error handling sweep** — replaced all runtime `.unwrap()` calls with `.expect("reason")` documenting invariants (mutex locks, container access, thread spawns). Added `// SAFETY:` comments to all 22 unsafe blocks across FFI bindings (WASAPI, PulseAudio, JACK, NDI, ALSA) and internal unsafe code (ring buffer, pipeline cache). Enabled `clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks` lint to prevent future regressions.
- **Idiomatic Rust pass** — eliminated per-frame allocations and unnecessary clones across the hot path:
  - `ParamStore::split_borrow()` for disjoint field access (removes 3× `defs.clone()` per frame in MIDI/OSC/WS update paths)
  - `PlaybackState` now derives `Copy` (removes `state.clone()` per frame in timeline tick)
  - Binding bus: snapshot moved instead of cloned; `HashMap::get_mut` fast-path for runtime lookup (avoids `binding.id.clone()` per enabled binding per frame)
  - Match on `&ParamDef` / `&TransformDef` references instead of cloning owned values
  - PFX hot-reload: `new_effect` moved instead of cloned; `old_effect` borrow replaces full clone
  - Shader hot-reload: effect borrowed from loader instead of cloned
  - Added `#[derive(Debug)]` to `BindingRuntime`, `LearnState`, `BindingTemplate`, `TemplateEntry`, `NdiFrame`, `PresetDecodeRequest`, `DepthFrame`; `Default`+`Clone` on `BindingRuntime`
  - `builtin_raster_images()` returns `&'static [String]` instead of `&'static Vec<String>`
  - MIDI panel: port selection deferred to after iteration (avoids `available_ports.clone()`)

### Fixed
- **Accretion drift** -- N-body simulation no longer drifts off-screen over time. Nonlinear centering force (gentle at origin, strong near edges), center-biased seed spawning, and tighter boundary kill prevent compounding center-of-mass shift

## v1.7.0 — 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Particle binding targets** — particle system settings (emit rate, burst on beat, lifetime, speed, size, drag, turbulence, gravity X/Y, vortex strength) exposed as `particle.*` targets in the binding bus. Applies to all layers' particle systems. New "Particles" group in Binding Matrix target picker.
- **Xbox Controller bridge** — `xbox_controller.py` streams gamepad inputs (analog sticks, triggers, d-pad, 11 buttons → 23 fields) into Phosphor's binding bus via `evdev`. Radial deadzone (configurable `--deadzone`), Y-axis inversion, auto-detect by name matching, hot-plug reconnection, 60 FPS default. Docker support with `privileged` + `/dev/input` mount.
- **Bridge source preview thumbnails** — vision bridges (MediaPipe hands/pose/face, YOLO) send annotated camera frame thumbnails (160x120 JPEG, ~8fps) over binary WebSocket. Phosphor decodes and renders inline previews in the binding matrix above each WS source group's fields, giving immediate visual feedback about camera position, detection quality, and model output.
  - `PhosphorBridge.push_preview(frame)` — rate-limited JPEG thumbnail sender with `--no-preview` and `--preview-fps` CLI flags
  - Binary WS wire format: `[source_name_utf8] [0x00] [jpeg_bytes]` — zero impact on numeric data path
  - Thumbnails auto-clean when source fields expire; hidden when group is collapsed (no decode overhead)

### Docs
- **Bridges README quick start** — added "What's a Bridge?" explainer and beginner-friendly quick start with three paths (no hardware, webcam, gamepad)

### Fixed
- **Multi-layer binding targets** — bindings now support explicit layer indices (`param.0.Turing.drag`) and auto-migrate legacy 3-part targets (`param.Accretion.trail_decay` → `param.1.Accretion.trail_decay`) on preset load, fixing bindings only affecting the active layer
- **Binding Matrix light theme readability** — replaced all hardcoded dark-mode colors (`from_white_alpha`, `from_black_alpha`, `from_rgb(0x22,...)`) with `ThemeColors` semantic equivalents so the UI is readable across all 6 themes (Dark, Light, Midnight, Ember, Neon, High Contrast)
- Added `text_dim`, `hover_fill`, `hover_border`, and `backdrop` fields to `ThemeColors` for fine-grained UI element theming
- **Binding Matrix collapse/expand all** — single toggle button in Sources and Targets column headers to collapse or expand all groups at once

### Changed
- **Configurable video device** — bridge docker-compose accepts `VIDEO_DEVICE` env var (e.g. `VIDEO_DEVICE=/dev/video4 docker compose up pose`) for multi-camera setups; host device is always mapped to `/dev/video0` inside the container so OpenCV finds it at index 0
- **YOLO bridge dynamic class detection** — no longer hardcodes 4 COCO classes; discovers all 80 classes at runtime and only sends fields for classes currently detected. Schema is re-sent when a new class first appears.
- **Per-field WS expiry** — binding bus now expires individual WS fields after 5s of no updates (was per-source). Unbound fields are removed from the picker; bound fields stay alive at 0.0 so bindings survive when a dynamic source temporarily disappears.
- **PhosphorBridge `send_schema()`** — new method to re-send schema mid-session for dynamic field discovery

### Added
- **Bridge Scripts** — Python companion scripts in `bridges/` for streaming external data into the binding bus via WebSocket
  - Base class `PhosphorBridge`: WS connect, schema declaration, data push, reconnect, graceful shutdown, common CLI args
  - 9 bridge scripts: MediaPipe hands/pose/face, YOLO object detection, RealSense depth, Smart LFO generator, iPhone ARKit (UDP), Leap Motion (placeholder), Azure Kinect (placeholder)
  - Test echo server for validating bridge output without Phosphor running
  - Split requirements files: base, vision, depth, lfo
  - Docker packaging: layered images (base → vision/lfo/realsense/leap), GPU variant, docker-compose with profiles
  - All bridges use the existing WS `/bind` protocol — no Rust code changes needed
- **Binding Bus** — universal source→transform→target system replacing per-parameter MIDI/OSC mappings
  - Any source (audio features, MIDI CC, OSC, WebSocket) can drive any target (effect params, layer opacity/blend/enabled, global opacity)
  - 10 composable transforms: remap, smooth, invert, quantize, deadzone, curve, gate, scale, offset, clamp
  - Preset-scoped and global-scoped bindings with JSON persistence (sidecar files for presets)
  - WebSocket `/bind` protocol: external apps send `{"type":"data","source":"...","fields":{...}}` for real-time control (e.g. MediaPipe hand tracking)
  - New Bindings panel in left sidebar with source legend, live value bars, inline transform editor, learn mode
  - Bindings panel UI overhaul: collapsible Preset/Global sections, two-line collapsed rows with accent bars and source badges, custom-painted source picker with live bars and WGSL uniform references, inline transform parameter editing with DragValues, Raw/Norm/Out preview area
  - Source picker shows friendly names for all 46 audio sources (e.g. "Sub Bass" instead of "band.0"), sub-grouped by type (Bands, Features, Beat, MFCC, Chroma)
  - Binding templates: 4 built-in presets (Audio Reactive, Beat Sync, Spectral Bands, MIDI Faders) with one-click apply
  - PostFX binding targets: bloom threshold/intensity, vignette, chromatic aberration, film grain
  - Scene transport binding targets: next cue, previous cue, stop
  - Raw shader uniform binding targets: override any of 23 uniform fields (audio bands, features, feedback_decay, time) directly from any source
  - One-time migration of legacy MIDI/OSC param mappings to bus bindings on first launch
  - MIDI and OSC systems now accumulate last-seen values for bus source collection (zero overhead on existing paths)
  - **Binding Matrix modal** — fullscreen three-column flow editor replacing sidebar bindings panel
    - Sources (left), binding cards (center), targets (right) with collapsible groups
    - Bezier connection lines between sources → cards → targets with animated flow dots
    - Expanded card editing: source/target pickers, transform pills, Raw/Norm/Out preview, learn mode
    - Effect/Global scope tabs, templates dropdown, keyboard shortcut `B` to toggle
    - Sidebar bindings section now shows compact stub with active count + "Matrix" button

### Fixed
- Bridge containers on Linux (native Docker Engine): added `extra_hosts: host.docker.internal:host-gateway` to all services so `host.docker.internal` resolves correctly (no-op on Docker Desktop)
- WebSocket binding sources now expire after 5 s of silence — `web.bind_values` was never cleared after ingestion, so stale keys kept refreshing `last_seen` and sources persisted forever
- Source picker dropdown overlap: moved `max_height` from inner `set_max_height()` (which capped content area) to `ComboBox::height()` (which caps scroll viewport), fixing row pile-up when content exceeded 350 px

## v1.6.0 — 2026-03-07

### Added
- Acknowledgments section in README — credits for third-party libraries, algorithms, research, and fonts
- Updated README feature table — compute rasterizer, 23 effects, MFCC/chroma audio, webcam/depth layers, scene cues
- Webcam device selector — enumerate and switch between multiple cameras in webcam layer panel, obstacle panel, and layer add button
- Persist selected webcam device in settings (remembered across restarts)
- FFmpeg webcam capture backend — opt-in setting for virtual cameras (Irium, DroidCam, etc.) that only expose DirectShow on Windows; uses `ffmpeg` subprocess instead of nokhwa, no new crate dependencies
- Preset save/restore resolves webcam by device name, with fallback to default
- Inline "Camera not available" indicator in webcam panel when capture is dead

### Changed
- Clean build: eliminated all 62 compiler warnings in phosphor-app (unused vars, dead code suppressions, borrow scope fix, removed dead `ParticleSourceRequest` enum and `recreate_draw_bind_groups` method)
- Suppressed 2 `unexpected_cfgs` warnings in vendored midir patch

### Fixed
- Webcam mirror checkbox now actually flips the image (was setting flag but shader never read it)
- Webcam device switch failure no longer kills the active capture — restores previous device on error
- Deduplicate webcam device list — Linux V4L2 exposes multiple nodes per physical camera (main, metadata, IR); now keeps only the lowest index per name
- Input device enumeration now works when native loopback (PulseAudio/WASAPI) is active — microphones and other input devices appear in the device selector dropdown
- Selecting a specific input device now correctly switches to cpal capture instead of re-entering the loopback path
- Deduplicate input device names (ALSA exposes multiple nodes per card with identical descriptions)
- Handle non-f32 sample formats (i16, i32) when opening input devices — fixes "Sample format 'f32' is not supported by hardware" error
- Suppress JACK client library stderr spam ("Cannot connect to server") via null error/info handlers on Linux
- Move device enumeration to background thread — eliminates ~200ms UI freeze from ALSA/JACK probing every scan cycle

## v1.5.0 — 2026-03-06

### Docs
- Add QUICK-REFERENCE.md with keyboard shortcuts, OSC/MIDI commands, and CLI flags

### Fixed
- Scene cue delete button disappearing when the same preset is added as a cue multiple times (egui widget ID collision)
- Crash (index out of bounds) when deleting a scene cue while the timeline is playing

### UI
- Right panel restyle: single-row param layout (name/slider/value/M/O), compact 16×14 MIDI/OSC badges, smaller Reset All button, large particle count header with 3px health bar, standalone bordered blend mode badge, compact particle param rows replacing grid, tab-strip obstacle source selector with active state styling, compact obstacle slider rows with separate value labels, audio mapping hover background lift with fixed-width 52px feature names
- Remove redundant activity dots from Settings subsection enable rows; status bar always shows MIDI/OSC/WEB/NDI indicators with three-state dots (active/enabled-idle/disabled)
- Consolidate MIDI, OSC, Web, NDI/Outputs, and Global into single collapsible "Settings" section with subsections — header shows labeled status dots, subsection headers use smaller font/arrow for visual hierarchy, protocol-specific badge colors
- Trigger grids (MIDI + OSC) use fixed-width label columns (52px) for proper badge alignment across rows
- OSC TX settings wrapped in subtle bordered frame; Global settings use fixed-width labels aligned to dropdowns
- Layers panel visual refresh: type color legend (FX/MD/WC), left color strip per card, layer index numbers, type badges, type-colored add buttons (all three on one row), subtle "Clear All" text link with red hover/confirm, footer type breakdown counts, hover-only delete buttons, stronger dimming for disabled layers
- Reorder sidebar panels: Effects → Layers → Presets → Scenes
- Layer badge shows "N/8" capacity format
- Scenes panel visual refresh: 2-column scene grid tiles, two-line cue rows with bottom progress bars (hold elapsed + transition progress with stripes), accent active-cue highlighting, pulsing red LIVE dot, GO button green fill, STOP red outline, hover-reveal delete buttons, hold time always visible, scrollable cue list (up to 6 visible), add-cue bar with separator
- Timeline bar polish: accent-colored active cue, striped from-cue during transitions, two-line target cue label (name + "Morph 58%"), transition-typed playhead colors
- Presets panel: add "Save current state as preset:" label above name input, and make "+ New" button clear all layers to a fresh Phosphor state with two-click confirmation when unsaved changes exist
- Amber dirty-state styling for presets panel: custom header with pulsing dot and inline preset name, amber-tinted dirty bar with Update/Reset buttons, amber selected tile, pulsing card border, and bumped tile height to 26px
- Add effect type indicators to effects panel: left color strip (purple SH / orange PS / teal FB), two-char badge, type legend, and footer breakdown count
- Add hover tooltips to effect type color legend explaining Shader, Particle+Shader, and Feedback categories
- Show Copy and Edit buttons side by side — Copy enabled for visible built-ins only, Edit enabled for user effects only; fixes Copy being clickable on hidden Phosphor branding effect
- Add "msc: N" badge to PARTICLES panel showing `max_scaled_count` with tooltip; merge blend mode and feature badges into single wrapping horizontal row; normalize morph section to 9pt font
- Add `EffectType` enum (Shader, Particle, Feedback) with optional `effect_type` field in .pfx format — auto-detects from data when absent
- Tag 5 feedback effects (Accretion, Array, Chaos, Mycelium, Turing) with explicit `"effect_type": "feedback"` in their .pfx files

### Audio
- Add `dominant_chroma` feature: CPU-side argmax of 12 chroma bins, normalized 0–1, forwarded to both fragment and particle GPU uniforms
- Cymatics audio remapping: chroma-driven Chladni mode selection (curated visually-distinct (n,m) pairs per pitch class), mfcc[0] vibrational amplitude, chroma peakedness pattern clarity
- Murmur audio remapping: mfcc[1] flock cohesion (bright=tight, dark=dispersed), mfcc[3] predator aggressiveness, flux speed agitation, dominant_chroma rim/sky hue; fix emitter waves by probing whole screen + inheriting donor heading
- Symbiosis audio remapping: mfcc[4-6] per-species force modulation (timbre shifts ecology), dominant_chroma species color rotation, flux interaction radius expansion, zcr Brownian noise jitter
- Morph audio remapping: dominant_chroma target shape selection (pitch class picks morph target instead of sequential), mfcc[1] transition speed modulation, mfcc[2] mid-transition scatter/explosion strength, chroma-tinted background
- Flux audio remapping: mfcc[1] curl strength (bright=tight spirals, dark=loose), flux-driven turbulence agitation, dominant_chroma emission/background hue anchor
- Add `zcr` (zero-crossing rate) to ParticleUniforms for compute shader access

### Effects
- Add obstacle collision to all 11 remaining particle sim shaders (phosphor, flux, murmur, raster, tesla, genesis, cymatics, symbiosis, turing, morph, as) — obstacles now work across all 16 effects

### Fixes
- Fix preset showing as dirty during ParamMorph scene transitions — morph interpolation now resets param changed flags since it's timeline playback, not user edits
- Clamp particle count to GPU dispatch dimension limit (`max_compute_workgroups_per_dimension × 256`) to prevent validation errors on high-count effects
- Add per-effect `max_scaled_count` field — quality multiplier won't push past this ceiling; applied to Accretion (60K), Genesis (24K), Murmur (2.4M), and Symbiosis (4M)
- Hide Stress test effect from effects panel
- Fix morph slider animating when auto-cycle mode is "Off" — transition progress now only advances when auto-cycling is active
- Remove redundant image source UI (IMG badge, image selector dropdown, Load Image/Video/Webcam buttons) from particle panel — morph targets handle image loading
- Fix morph snapshot/image/text/video filling wrong slot when `target_count` diverges from def count — all handlers now use def vector length for slot selection and pad gaps

### Morph Effect (New)
- **Shape target morphing**: particles store home positions for up to 4 target shapes and morph between them on beat drops with spring physics and turbulence
- **Multiple target types**: image files, geometry shapes (circle, ring, grid, spiral, heart, star), and random scatter — mixed freely across 4 slots
- **5 transition styles**: Spring (default), Explode-reform, Flow (curl noise), Cascade (left-to-right wave), and Direct (pure lerp) — selectable via UI dropdown
- **Per-particle stagger**: each particle transitions at a slightly different time for organic cascading motion
- **Audio reactivity**: onset triggers morph to next target, bass drives spring vibration, mid adds turbulence during transition, brilliance creates scatter
- **Strided aux buffer**: 4x normal aux size interleaves target data (32MB at 500K particles), no bind group changes
- **ParticleUniforms extended**: 4 new fields (morph_progress, morph_source, morph_dest, morph_flags) — 784→800 bytes, existing effects unaffected
- **Morph UI controls**: target slot display with click-to-morph buttons, transition progress bar, auto-cycle mode (Off/On Beat/Timed), hold duration slider, transition style dropdown, runtime image and geometry loading into morph slots
- **Text morph targets**: type any string in the morph panel and particles form the letters — uses fontdue to rasterize Inter-Bold glyphs into a bitmap, then samples through the standard image pipeline. Supports `"text:HELLO"` in .pfx files
- **Video frame morph targets**: click "+ Video" to load a video file — evenly-spaced frames fill available morph slots (up to 4), cycling between different video frames on beat
- **Snapshot morph targets**: click "Snapshot" to freeze current particle positions into a new morph target — GPU readback captures alive particles as a reusable shape

### WBOIT (Weighted Blended Order-Independent Transparency)
- **Order-independent transparency**: new `"blend": "wboit"` mode approximates correct alpha compositing in a single unsorted pass — no back-to-front sort needed
- **Two-pass rendering**: particles render into accumulation (Rgba16Float) + revealage (R8Unorm) targets with WBOIT weight function, then a fullscreen composite blends onto the scene
- **Automatic compute raster fallback**: WBOIT is incompatible with compute rasterization; `"render_mode": "compute"` + `"wboit"` falls back to billboard with a warning, and `"auto"` mode excludes WBOIT effects
- **Resize-safe**: WBOIT textures recreated on window resize alongside compute raster framebuffer

### Symbiosis Effect (New)
- **Multi-species particle life simulation**: 2–8 species interact via an asymmetric 8×8 force matrix, producing emergent ecosystems, crystals, and predator-prey dynamics
- **6 named presets**: Ecosystem, Crystals, Hunters, Membrane, Chaos, Symmetric — smoothly interpolated on switch
- **Audio-reactive matrix**: bass boosts force scale, mid modulates friction, presence/brilliance expand interaction radius, onset shuffles random matrix entries for emergent disruption
- **Toroidal topology**: particles wrap around screen edges with correct wrapped-distance neighbor queries
- **Force matrix in ParticleUniforms**: 8×8 float matrix (256 bytes) appended to uniforms — no new bind groups needed, all existing effects unaffected

### Fix: CR scatter bind group crash on particle quality change
- **Request adapter-supported buffer limits**: device now requests the GPU adapter's actual `max_storage_buffer_binding_size` and `max_buffer_size` instead of wgpu defaults (128MB/256MB), allowing high-VRAM GPUs to use their full capacity
- **Cap particle count to device limits**: after applying quality multiplier, particle count is clamped so the largest buffer (`sorted_particles_buffer` = N×9×4 bytes) stays within the device's storage buffer binding limit — prevents invalid bind groups and crash on quality change

### Gaussian Area Splat for Compute Rasterizer (Fix)
- **Soft Gaussian splat for particles >1.5px**: compute raster now matches billboard renderer output for larger particles (e.g., Array at ~2.7px radius). Previously all energy concentrated into a 2×2 bilinear kernel, making dim-colored effects nearly invisible
- **Three-tier kernel**: single-pixel (≤1px), bilinear 2×2 (1–1.5px), Gaussian area splat (>1.5px, capped at 8px). Weight `col.a × glow²` matches billboard's `SrcAlpha` blend
- **Multi-tile binning**: particles overlapping multiple 16×16 tiles are binned/scattered to all covered tiles (up to 3×3). Sorted buffer sized 9× max_particles accordingly
- **Tiled path support**: Gaussian loop in shared-memory tiled shader with per-pixel tile boundary clipping

### Preset: Particle Image Save/Restore (Fix)
- **Particle image path now saved in presets**: selecting a different particle image (e.g., skull → phoenix) and updating the preset persists the choice across preset loads
- **Mark dirty on particle/obstacle changes**: changing particle image, video source, webcam source, video transport settings, or obstacle settings now marks the preset as dirty so the Update button appears
- **Backward compatible**: old presets without `particle_image_path` load normally (default image from .pfx)

### Particle Quality Setting (New)
- **Global quality multiplier**: Low (0.25x), Medium (0.5x), High (1x), Ultra (2x), Max (4x) — scales both `max_count` and `emit_rate` proportionally so fill time stays consistent
- **Default: High (1x)** — no change for existing users; backward-compatible with old settings.json files
- **Combo box in Global panel**: same pattern as theme selector; changing quality mid-session reloads the active effect to rebuild GPU buffers
- **Built-in effects upgraded**: all effects now default to 1–2M particles with compute rasterization as the baseline

### Window Size
- **Default window size changed to 1920×1080** (was 1280×720)

### Compute Rasterization (New)
- **Atomic framebuffer rendering**: 3-pass compute raster pipeline bypasses vertex→rasterizer→fragment for sub-pixel particles. Eliminates 2×2 fragment quad waste and rasterizer bottleneck for high particle counts
- **Fixed-point encoding**: 12-bit fractional precision (4096 scale) via `atomicAdd` on 4 separate i32 storage buffers (R/G/B/A), supporting up to ~1000 overlapping particles per pixel within i32 range
- **Size-adaptive kernel**: single-pixel fast path for particles ≤1.5px, Gaussian kernel footprint for 1.5–5px, billboard fallback for larger particles
- **Render mode field**: `"render_mode"` in .pfx files — `"billboard"` (default), `"compute"`, or `"auto"` (auto-selects compute for ≥100K particles with no sprites/trails and size ≤0.005)
- **Fullscreen resolve**: render pass with hardware blend state (additive or alpha) reads decoded framebuffer with Reinhard tonemapping for additive mode
- **COMPUTE badge**: cyan badge in particle panel when compute rasterization is active
- **Tiled shared-memory accumulation**: 4-pass bin→prefix-sum→scatter→tile-raster pipeline for ≥50K particles. Accumulates in 4 KB workgroup shared memory per 16×16 tile (~100× faster atomics), then flushes to global framebuffer with plain stores. Direct draw path retained as fallback for low counts. Automatic path selection based on 1-frame-latent alive count

### Performance & Build Optimization
- **Build profiles**: dev builds use opt-level 1 (deps at 2 for faster shader compilation), release uses thin LTO + codegen-units=1
- **GPU buffer clears**: spatial hash dispatch uses `encoder.clear_buffer()` instead of allocating a zeroed Vec per frame (up to 262KB saved per frame at max grid)
- **Sort params cached**: bitonic sort parameters written once at buffer creation via `mapped_at_creation` instead of ~210 `write_buffer` calls per frame
- **Parallel prefix sum**: spatial hash prefix sum upgraded from single-thread sequential to 256-thread Blelloch scan with shared memory (supports up to 65K cells)
- **Pipeline cache**: compiled shader data persisted to `~/.config/phosphor/pipeline_cache.bin` for faster startup on subsequent launches
- **Device loss handling**: GPU device lost callback + uncaptured error handler + graceful render-time detection (no more hard crash on driver reset)
- **GPU profiler** (`--features profiling`): wgpu-profiler integration with egui overlay panel, timestamp query support
- **Clippy pedantic**: workspace-level clippy lints enabled, auto-fixed 500+ warnings, rustfmt config added
- **FxHashMap**: `rustc-hash` for runtime-only hash maps (MIDI trigger tracking)

### Audio Panel Redesign (Improved)
- **BPM ring**: circular beat-phase arc with orbiting dot replaces static BPM number; flashes white on downbeat
- **Chroma wheel**: radial 12-segment pie chart with energy-proportional radius replaces linear bars; dominant note displayed in center
- **MFCC heatmap**: single-row dark blue→cyan→white timbral fingerprint replaces bar graph; selective labels (DC, Slope, Shape, Formant, Det6)
- **Spectrum bars**: vertical gradient mesh bars (bright top→faded bottom) with peak-hold markers (0.95 decay)
- **Dynamics section**: 7 labeled rows with thin track bars + percentage values; kick uses boolean dot indicator
- **Section headers**: self-documenting sections (SPECTRUM 7 bands, DYNAMICS 7 features, CHROMA 12 pitch classes, TIMBRE·MFCC 13 coefficients)
- **Tooltips**: per-bar spectrum tooltips (name, Hz range, character), per-row dynamics tooltips (feature description), per-cell MFCC tooltips (coefficient meaning), chroma wheel and BPM ring tooltips
- **Footer**: feature count summary (7 bands · 7 dynamics · 12 chroma · 13 mfcc · 512 fft)

### MFCC + Chroma Audio Feature Extraction (New)
- **13 Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients**: captures timbral content — different instruments/voices produce distinct MFCC patterns. Computed from 26-band mel filterbank + DCT-II on the existing 4096-pt FFT
- **12 Chroma pitch-class energies**: maps spectral energy to musical pitch classes (C through B). Individual notes/chords light up specific bars. Frequency range 20–5000 Hz
- **GPU-accessible**: new `mfcc(i)` and `chroma_val(i)` WGSL helper functions in both fragment and compute shaders. ShaderUniforms 256→288 bytes, ParticleUniforms 416→528 bytes
- **Audio panel visualization**: chromatic-colored chroma bars (12 pitch classes) and MFCC bar graph in the audio panel overlay
- **Smoothed + normalized**: 25 new features go through the existing adaptive normalizer and asymmetric EMA smoother (attack 0.03s, release 0.15s)
- **Non-breaking**: existing effects unchanged — they simply don't read the new fields. NUM_FEATURES 20→45

### Spatial Hash Grid (Improved)
- **Dynamic grid sizing**: `grid_dims(N)` computes `clamp(sqrt(N/16), 40, 256)` — grid scales automatically with particle count instead of fixed 40×40
- **Shader constant patching**: SH_GRID_W/H constants in particle_lib, count, prefix_sum, and scatter shaders patched at pipeline creation time
- **Particle panel slider fix**: emit_rate slider max now scales to 10% of max_count for high-count effects (e.g. 100K emit_rate for 1M particles)

### Murmur Effect (Upgraded)
- **Topological K=7 nearest neighbors**: replaced fixed-radius Boids with scale-free K-nearest neighbor queries — flock correlations work from 40K to 1M particles without parameter tuning
- **Vicsek noise phase transitions**: angular noise (eta parameter) modulated by bass drives order→chaos transitions; proper research-accurate model instead of ad-hoc disorder
- **Predator avoidance**: Lissajous-drifting predator with onset-triggered strike jumps; exponential falloff repulsion causes realistic flock splits
- **Heading-level roost centering**: quadratic ramp centering force feeds into heading computation (not just position) — prevents alignment-consensus drift that plagued the old position-only correction
- **KNN-based rim lighting**: edge detection from neighbor anisotropy (COM displacement / k-radius); color_mode slider (0=silhouette, 1=full rim); audio-reactive brightness (RMS) and color temperature (centroid: cool blue ↔ warm amber)
- **Non-accumulating color**: base color re-derived from gradient each frame instead of reading previous frame's output — prevents wash-out over time
- **Adaptive separation**: K-th neighbor distance as interaction scale; density-invariant at any particle count
- **Donor-based emission**: new particles spawn near existing flock members for organic growth
- 1M particles, 8 params (noise_eta, cohesion, color_mode, predator, separation, speed, smoothing, audio_drive), alpha blending, bloom postprocess

### Mycelium Effect (New)
- **Chain-based growth system**: 2,500 pre-allocated chains (80 segments max each, 200K particles total) — leader particles at tips follow curl noise flow fields while depositing follower particles that form spring-connected tendrils
- **Self-activation architecture**: dead particles detect when they should activate by reading chain state from the input buffer — no cross-thread writes, no race conditions. Growth propagates via time-based segment intervals
- **Branching on audio onset**: reserve chains (beyond initial 100 leaders) self-activate by branching from random active chain tips; onset boosts branch probability 15×, brilliance widens branch angles
- **Spring physics**: followers connected by asymmetric springs (strong toward tip, weak toward root) with critical damping; creates organic elastic motion through the network
- **Death cascade**: roots age faster with spectral flux; when a root dies, death propagates tip-ward with 50ms/segment delay — visual dissolve from root to tip, then chain slot recycles for new branches
- **4 color modes**: depth (teal-blue root → forest green → phosphorescent tip), generation (teal/gold/magenta by branch depth), velocity (dim blue → bright green), age (bright green → dark brown)
- **Beat-phase traveling wave**: periodic brightness pulse travels root→tip synced to detected beat, modulated by RMS
- **Bioluminescent feedback trails**: background shader with differential RGB decay (green persists longest), organic noise warp for living feel, HDR clamp
- **Audio integration**: bass→growth speed, onset→branching, mid→curl intensity, brilliance→branch angle, flux→death rate, beat_phase→traveling glow, rms→brightness, centroid→hue shift
- 200K particles, 8 params, additive blending, bloom postprocess, obstacle collision

### Chaos Effect (New)
- **Strange attractor dynamics**: 5 classic attractors (Lorenz, Rössler, Halvorsen, Thomas, Chen) with RK4 integration — particles trace chaotic trajectories that reveal butterfly, torus, and knot-like shapes through accumulated feedback trails
- **Attractor morphing**: spectral centroid smoothly blends between adjacent attractor types; slider + audio drive crossfade the derivative functions (all attractors normalized to [-1,1] space)
- **Audio-reactive bifurcation**: bass shifts the bifurcation parameter across chaos boundaries (e.g. Lorenz ρ through ~24.74), onset provides impulse push past critical points for dramatic order→chaos transitions
- **RK4 integrator**: 4th-order Runge-Kutta for accurate trajectory integration; brilliance modulates time step for faster/more chaotic motion at high frequencies
- **4 color modes**: velocity (blue→gold speed ramp), z-depth (cool→warm gradient), wing (cyan vs magenta by sign of attractor x), age (bright warm→dim cool fade)
- **Feedback trail rendering**: background shader with centripetal UV warp, differential RGB decay (red fades fastest → cool aging trails), HDR clamp
- **3D projection**: slow constant-speed Y-axis rotation, perspective depth scaling via projection param, depth-based size and brightness modulation
- **Divergence guard**: NaN/out-of-bounds particles reset to random position near origin; soft clamp to normalized space prevents runaway
- 50K particles, 8 params, additive blending, bloom postprocess, obstacle collision

### Turing Effect (New)
- **Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion**: full 2D R-D simulation on ping-pong compute textures, running N steps/frame (default 8, audio-modulated up to 32)
- **Hybrid R-D + particles**: 200K particles sample the R-D field for gradient-based chemotactic forces, flowing toward high-concentration pattern regions
- **Particle coloring from chemistry**: color, size, and alpha derived from local B concentration — particles are visible in pattern regions, transparent in substrate
- **Audio-reactive chemistry**: bass→feed rate (2.5× boost), mid→kill rate (2.5× boost), brilliance→diffuse_b, onset injects 4 randomized B drops per beat (PCG hash, 0.35 strength), beat doubles sim steps
- **Particle audio reactivity**: onset pulses gradient force (3× surge), bass pumps particle size, beat kicks velocity, RMS brightness (0.8 coeff), centroid shifts palette (0.5 coeff)
- **Gray-Scott parameter space**: feed/kill rate sliders traverse spots → worms → mitosis → coral → chaos regimes
- **R-D infrastructure**: new `ReactionDiffusionDef` in particle types, `RDUniforms` struct, group 4 bind group for particle compute, `create_rd_resources()` factory
- 512×512 R-D grid, 8 params (gradient_strength, drag, feed_rate, kill_rate, diffuse_b, sim_speed, drop_size, brightness)

### Accretion Effect (New)
- **Tiled N-body gravity**: O(N²) gravitational simulation using workgroup shared-memory tiling (GPU Gems 3 Ch. 31) — every particle attracts every other, forming orbital systems, accretion discs, and slingshot ejections
- **Angular-momentum-preserving damping**: only radial velocity is damped, preserving tangential (orbital) velocity for stable long-lived disc structure
- **Audio seed injection**: beat onsets inject "seed" particles (local attractors within the disc); seed mass scales with `mid`, gravity strength modulated by `bass`
- **Spiral feedback trails**: background shader warps trails with inward pull + rotation, creating galaxy-like spiral arms; differential RGB decay shifts aging trails from warm gold to cool blue
- **4 init patterns**: disc (tangential orbits), ring (near-circular), two-body (binary system), collapse (zero-velocity infall)
- **3 color modes**: velocity (blue→gold), proximity to seeds (blue→orange), orbital energy (blue=bound, red=escaping)
- **Audio reactivity**: onset brightness flash (warm-tinted), bass particle size breathing, RMS glow, bass/mid drive feedback warp strength
- 30K particles, 8 params, additive blending, central pressure support, obstacle collision

### Array Effect (New)
- **Audio-band speaker emitters**: 5 toroidal ring emitters, one per frequency band (sub-bass through brilliance), each firing disc-shaped particle rings outward like speaker cones pushing air
- **Two layout modes**: vertical speaker stack (default) and concentric rings — crossfade with `layout` param
- **Per-band audio reactivity**: each emitter responds to its own frequency band for emission density, speed, and glow
- **Beat-phase breathing**: ring radii modulate with beat phase for rhythmic pulsing
- **ParticleUniforms expanded** 400→416 bytes: added `low_mid`, `upper_mid`, `presence`, `brilliance` audio fields to compute shaders (all 7 bands now available)
- 300K particles, 8 params (trail_decay, ring_radius, spread, layout, color_mode, speed_mult, beat_pulse, emitter_glow)

### Obstacle Refinements
- **Contain mode**: new collision mode that traps particles inside the obstacle shape — inverted collision test, binary search, and normals
- **Flow Around improvement**: redirects approach energy into tangential direction instead of stripping it, preventing pile-ups
- **Video obstacles**: luminance-to-alpha conversion so video frames work as obstacles (bright = solid, dark = passable); UI now shows "Video: filename"
- **Webcam cleanup**: Clear and source-switching now properly stop webcam/depth when no longer needed
- **Tooltips**: all obstacle panel controls have descriptive hover text

### Monocular Depth Estimation (New)
- Feature-gated `depth`: `cargo run --features depth,webcam` for MiDaS v2.1 small monocular depth estimation
- Webcam frames → background `phosphor-depth` thread → ONNX Runtime (ort crate) → 256×256 depth map → obstacle texture
- Particles collide with person's depth silhouette — nearby objects block, far objects pass through
- Model download from HuggingFace (~66 MB), user-initiated via UI button with progress indicator
- Model cached at `~/.config/phosphor/models/midas_v21_small_256.onnx`
- 1-2 frame latency depth pipeline: bounded(1) channels, try_send drops stale frames
- UI: "Depth" button in Obstacle panel (auto-shows "Download" if model missing, progress % during download)
- Preset save/load: `obstacle_depth` field with backward-compatible serde defaults
- 7 new tests (downscale, model path, download progress states, preset serde) — 352 total

### Obstacle Collision (New)
- Image-based 2D obstacle textures for particle collision — load PNG/JPEG/WebP with alpha channel
- 3 collision modes: **Bounce** (reflect velocity along surface normal, scale by elasticity), **Stick** (zero velocity, hold at surface), **Flow Around** (tangent projection, remove normal component)
- Obstacle texture extends compute group 1 bind group (bindings 2+3) alongside existing flow field
- WGSL collision helpers in `particle_lib.wgsl`: `obstacle_alpha()`, `obstacle_normal()` (central-difference gradient), `apply_obstacle_collision()` — any `*_sim.wgsl` can call them with 3 lines
- `ParticleUniforms` extended 384→400 bytes: obstacle_enabled, obstacle_threshold, obstacle_mode, obstacle_elasticity
- Collapsible "Obstacle" UI panel in right sidebar: enable toggle, Load Image (rfd), Clear, mode dropdown, threshold/elasticity sliders
- Integrated into Cascade effect; same 3-line pattern (`prev_pos`, integrate, `apply_obstacle_collision`) works in any particle sim
- Preset save/load with backward-compatible serde defaults
- Opaque image support: images without alpha (JPEG, opaque PNG) auto-detect and use luminance as collision mask — dark areas are passthrough, bright areas are solid
- Anti-strobe: binary search finds exact surface contact point along integration step (4 iterations), places particle just outside surface; velocity reflection only when moving into obstacle
- Texture format `Rgba8Unorm` (not sRGB) for raw data sampling; UV Y-flip for correct clip→texture mapping
- 6 new tests (ObstacleMode conversions, preset serde, backward compat, alpha preprocessing) — 351 total

### Cascade Effect (Fix)
- Fixed beat flash strobe: replaced binary `u.beat` full-screen flash with smooth `beat_phase` envelope (fast 25%-of-beat quadratic fade), reduced amplitude from 0.05 to 0.03

### Cascade Effect (New)
- **Cascade**: solid walls of particles emit inward from all 4 screen edges, audio-segmented by frequency band
- Pixel-perfect wall emission: particle index maps deterministically to perimeter pixels (1920 top/bottom + 1080 left/right at 1080p), guaranteeing gap-free solid walls that scale with resolution
- Band-to-edge mapping: bottom=bass+sub_bass (red-orange), left=mid (teal), right=mid (blue-violet), top=centroid (white-cyan)
- Audio directly drives wall penetration depth: band energy controls particle speed, so walls extend/retract with the music like Aurora's ribbons
- Continuous audio push force during simulation keeps accelerating particles when their band is active
- Curl noise turbulence for organic lateral drift, beat-triggered velocity pulse, onset jitter
- 3 color modes: band colors (4 distinct per edge), monochrome white-blue, speed/energy gradient
- Background shader: feedback trails with directional inward UV warp, per-band audio-reactive edge glow strips (width scales with audio), beat flash
- Functions as both standalone effect and layerable edge frame via convergence param + brightness alpha compositing
- 8 params: trail_decay, inward_speed, spread, curl_strength, color_mode, edge_glow, convergence, beat_sync

### Genesis Effect (Retuned)
- **Genesis** (Particle Lenia): retuned from reference implementation (znah.net/lenia) for proper self-organizing behavior
- Ring kernel calibrated to reference ratios: peak at 30% of R, width 23% of R (proper ring with falloff)
- Kernel weight W_K scaled from 0.003 → 0.02 for correct field density at particle count
- Interaction radius narrowed to [0.05, 0.20] from [0.10, 0.50] — manageable search radius
- Removed curl rotation (was compensating for over-smooth density field at 20K)
- Stronger growth forces (step×0.10) and higher speed cap (MAX_SPEED=0.25) for VJ-paced dynamics
- Soft radial containment spring past screen edge + hard clamp safety net (replaces square boundary)
- Beat-triggered seed drops: ~3% of particles teleport to a random screen location on each beat, creating fresh organisms that self-organize from the music
- 9 initial seed clusters in 3×3 grid (fills screen), zero-mean paired-hash noise (no drift bias)
- Stronger bloom (threshold 0.15, intensity 0.55) for visual presence

### Tesla Effect (New)
- **Tesla** (magnetic field): 200K charged particles follow magnetic field lines as a flow field, creating interweaving helical trajectories
- Magnetic monopole flow field: particles follow superposition of dipole field directions; charge sign determines direction along field lines (+charge follows B, -charge follows -B)
- 4 dipole arrangements via `dipole_mode` param: parallel (same polarity), antiparallel (bar magnet, default), ring (4 alternating), quadrupole (4 + oscillating center)
- Orbital correction near poles: smoothly blends field-following to tangential orbit, preventing convergence at sink poles
- Helical oscillation: per-particle perpendicular sine wave with random phase, controlled by `helix_tightness`
- Proximity dimming: particles near dipoles render dim, brightening as they arc away
- Charge-based coloring: cyan for positive, magenta for negative; `charge_ratio` controls mix
- Audio-reactive: bass drives flow speed, onset triggers velocity jitter, beat triggers per-particle polarity flips (cyan↔magenta)
- 3 color modes: charge-based (cyan/magenta), speed-based (cool→hot), lifetime gradient (cool→warm)
- Feedback trails with electric UV shimmer, dim background field line visualization
- 8 params: trail_decay, field_strength, charge_ratio, dipole_mode, field_rotation, color_mode, helix_tightness, flip_sensitivity

### AoS → SoA Particle Buffer Refactor
- **Structure of Arrays layout**: split single 64-byte `Particle` storage buffer into 4 separate 16-byte SoA buffers (`pos_life`, `vel_size`, `color`, `flags`) — position-only reads (spatial hash, sort keygen) now load 16 instead of 64 bytes per particle (4× bandwidth savings)
- **13-entry compute bind group**: bindings 1-4 read, 5-8 write, 9 counters, 10 aux, 11 dead, 12 alive indices
- **6-entry render bind group**: 4 SoA read buffers + uniforms + alive indices
- **`read_particle()` / `write_particle()` helpers** in particle_lib.wgsl — effect compute shaders use convenience functions, hot-path neighbor reads (murmur boids) access individual arrays directly
- **Spatial hash and sort keygen optimized**: count/scatter shaders bind only `pos_life`, sort keygen binds only `vel_size`
- Request `max_storage_buffers_per_shader_stage: 16` (all desktop GPUs support this)
- Total memory identical (64 bytes/particle), just reorganized for better GPU cache line utilization

### Raster Shard Flex
- **Flexible shard motion**: Voronoi shards deform organically instead of moving as rigid blocks — distance-dependent rotation twist, per-particle noise within shards, and wider burst spread with outer particles flying further

### Raster Grid Artifact Fix
- **Jittered grid sampling**: ±0.4×step deterministic offset per particle breaks up visible row/column banding in smooth gradient areas
- **Bilinear color interpolation**: fractional pixel positions sample from 4 surrounding pixels, eliminating color stairstepping in gradients
- **Gradient-based size modulation**: luminance gradient magnitude stored in `home.w`; smooth areas get 30% larger particles (fill gaps), edges stay neutral
- **Sparkle boost**: bright pixels at high-gradient locations (stars, glints) get audio-reactive size pulsing — per-particle phase offset creates independent twinkling driven by onset and mids
- New unit tests for jitter, bilinear sampling, and gradient helpers

### Raster Image Loading Fixes
- **Fix 2048x2048 image loading**: `upload_aux_data()` no longer shrinks aux buffer below `max_particles` size — subsequent `update_aux_in_place()` calls for larger images were silently dropped
- **Fix image selector not updating**: switching built-in images now updates `ps.def.emitter.image` so the ComboBox reflects the active selection
- **Fix particle slider clamping**: slider ranges now dynamically extend to include the current value — prevents Raster's `emit_rate=100K` / `lifetime=999` from being silently clamped to slider defaults, which corrupted the effect every frame the panel was drawn
- **Built-in effects are runtime-only**: particle slider changes no longer write back to `effect_loader` for built-in effects — use presets to persist tweaks
- **Warning on aux buffer overflow**: `update_aux_in_place()` now logs a warning when a write is skipped due to buffer size
- Raster particle cap raised from 500K to 2M (covers 2048² images at grid step=1)
- Raster default particle size reduced from 0.004 to 0.002

### Particle Video/Webcam Source + Transitions
- **Video as particle source**: Raster (and any image-emitter effect) can now use video files as particle source — particles update home positions per-frame tracking video content
- **Webcam as particle source**: live webcam feed drives particle positions in real-time (feature-gated `webcam`)
- **Source transitions**: smooth 0.5s interpolation of particle home positions when switching between image/video/webcam sources (no hard snap)
- **Per-frame aux updates**: pre-allocated aux buffer at `max_particles` size enables `write_buffer` updates without recreating GPU bind groups (8MB DMA transfer for 500K particles)
- **`sample_rgba_buffer()`**: new function samples raw RGBA byte data directly, skipping file I/O — used for video frame and webcam frame particle sampling
- **UI source controls**: particle panel shows source type badge (IMG/VIDEO/CAM), source name, Load Video / Webcam buttons (feature-gated), video transport (play/pause, speed, loop, seek)
- **Preset save/load**: particle video path, speed, looping, and webcam source persisted in `LayerPreset` with serde defaults for backward compat
- **Load Image button**: users can load custom PNG/JPEG/WebP images as particle source (replaces default image)
- **Animated GIF as particle source**: GIFs with multiple frames auto-detect as animated source with per-frame particle position updates (same as video, no feature gate required)
- **Background loading**: all particle source loading (image, GIF, video) happens on a background thread via `ParticleSourceLoader` — no UI freeze during decode
- **EmitterDef `video` field**: `.pfx` files can specify `"video": "clip.mp4"` or `"video": "webcam"` for built-in video/webcam source at effect load time
- Video decode reuses existing `media/video.rs` infrastructure (ffmpeg pre-decode to RAM, 60s max)
- **Built-in image selector**: combo box in particle panel for quick-switching between bundled raster images (skull, phoenix, jellyfish, hand, samurai_mask) without file dialog
- **Morph-safe preset loading**: when a preset layer has the same effect already loaded, skip the full effect reload — keeps particle systems alive so morph transitions interpolate params smoothly instead of destroying and rebuilding all particles
- 12 new tests: `sample_rgba_buffer` (5), `ParticleImageSource` (2), `SourceTransition` (3), `LayerPreset` serde (3), `EmitterDef` serde with video (2)

### Raster Effect (New)
- **Raster** (video wall): 500K particles map to image pixel positions, colored by source image
- Voronoi shard fragmentation: 32 seed points create irregular fragments with per-shard rotation, translation, and depth variation
- Frayed edges: particles near Voronoi cell boundaries break free with individual jitter
- Three bass displacement modes via `bass_mode` param: shards (default), tangential swirl, radial push
- 2D sinusoidal wave displacement from mids, onset-driven per-particle scatter from highs
- Spring-return physics pull particles back to displaced home positions (sustained audio holds displacement)
- Beat onset impulse with shard-coherent burst direction
- Luminance-based particle sizing: brighter pixels render larger for visual depth
- 8 exposed params: trail_decay, spring_k, bass_strength, mid_wave, high_scatter, burst_force, depth_scale, bass_mode
- Optional feedback trails via trail_decay for motion blur during scatter
- Image source `MAX_DIM` raised from 512 to 2048 for higher-resolution sampling

### Particle Effects Overhaul
- **Delete 4 effects**: removed Coral, Helix, Nova, Vortex (low quality, never worked well)
- **Murmuration → Murmur**: renamed, removed feedback trails (root cause of "sperm" look), brighter sky for contrast, larger/darker/more opaque particles (0.014 size, 0.9 alpha), reduced count 70K→40K
- **Ribbons fix**: lower feedback clamp 0.12→0.06, stronger vignette, halved particle brightness and alpha to prevent additive washout
- **Veil fix**: lower feedback cap 0.4→0.15, stronger decay dampening, halved particle brightness and alpha, minimum dampening floor even without audio
- **Cymatics enhancement**: 25K→50K particles, emit rate 1700→3500, burst 100→500, 3 new params (rotation, symmetry, glow), more vivid color gradient, stronger nodal line contrast
- **Swarm → Spirograph**: complete reimagine — hypotrochoid parametric curves with 5 arms of different petal-count patterns, drifting centers, audio-reactive ratio morphing. 6 params: trail_decay, draw_speed, pattern_scale, complexity, drift, color_spread
- **Spirograph** (new): multi-pattern hypotrochoid curves with 5 arms of distinct petal-count patterns, drifting centers, audio-reactive ratio morphing. Replaces Swarm.
- **Compute shader `param()` access**: particle compute shaders can now access effect params 0-7 via `param(i)` helper, forwarded from ParamStore through `effect_params` fields in ParticleUniforms (repurposed padding bytes, no size change)
- Updated Crucible and Spectral Eye presets (Swarm→Spirograph)
- Effect count: 15 curated effects (was 12 before particle additions, peaked at 19, now curated down to 15)

### Particle System Hardening for 1M Support
- **GPU-side buffer zero-init**: replaced CPU `vec![0u8; 128MB]` + `write_buffer` with `encoder.clear_buffer()` — eliminates 128MB+ CPU allocation at 1M particles
- **Device limits validation**: `max_count` clamped to device `max_storage_buffer_binding_size` with log warning
- **Bitonic sort auto-cap**: depth sort auto-disabled above 65K particles (would require 210 dispatches/frame at 1M)
- **Trail buffer safety**: trails disabled above 500K particles; trail length capped to fit device binding limit

### Parameter Persistence
- **Slider values persist to .pfx**: adjusting parameters in the Parameters panel now updates the `default` values in the .pfx file for user effects, so values survive effect reload and app restart
- Debounced 500ms save — writes only after slider stops moving, not on every frame
- Editor's Effect tab stays in sync when params are saved from UI

### Shader Editor
- **Fix: Save now persists both tabs**: Save (Ctrl+S) writes both the active and paired file when either has unsaved changes — previously only saved the currently active tab, losing edits to the other file

### Effect Browser
- **Particle badge**: small accent-colored dot in top-right corner of effect buttons that use particles
- **Particle count in hover**: hover text shows particle count (e.g. "70K particles", "1M particles")

### Veil Effect
- Fix feedback blowout on loud audio: particle brightness now decreases with volume, stronger loudness dampening on alpha, audio-reactive decay, lowered feedback clamp

### Helix Effect Overhaul
- **Dipole field-guided particles**: replaced uniform B_z Lorentz force with magnetic dipole field — particles follow curved field lines from emitter, creating visible force field pattern through trails
- **Helical oscillation**: perpendicular oscillation around field lines (charge-dependent CW/CCW), bass tightens helix frequency
- **Feedback warps along field**: particle trails flow along magnetic field direction with chromatic aberration, creating persistent field line visualization
- **Dark background**: replaced overpowering painted field lines with near-black background + very subtle dipole hints; particles are the main visual
- **Bright particles**: brightness 0.22→0.70, alpha 0.30→0.55, particle size 0.010→0.018; emit rate 100→200 for dense field coverage
- **Beat burst**: speed pulse along field lines on beat detection; onset scatters particles laterally off field lines
- **Tuned post-processing**: bloom threshold 0.50→0.35, bloom intensity 0.45→0.60 for force-field glow; brighter saturated color gradient

### Chaos Effect Overhaul
- **Visible Lorenz butterfly**: fixed base rho from 22 (below chaos threshold) to 28 (canonical chaotic regime); particles now trace the iconic butterfly attractor pattern
- **XZ butterfly projection**: replaced Y-axis rotation with XZ plane view (the classic Lorenz butterfly orientation) plus gentle ±8° tilt oscillation for 3D depth feel
- **Stable attractor dynamics**: reduced audio modulation of sigma/rho/beta to subtle range (was dramatically reshaping the attractor every frame); fixed `time * audio-varying` rotation bug that caused violent camera jumps
- **Trail-based visualization**: dim particles (alpha × 0.2) with high trail persistence (decay 0.92) accumulate into visible trajectory lines; clean feedback without twist distortion preserves tight attractor lines
- **Density increase**: 20K particles at 500/s emit (was 6K at 80/s) for dense attractor coverage
- **Removed dead params**: attractor_mix, zoom, speed inputs were not wired to compute shader (compute shaders cannot access `param()`)
- **Brightness fixes**: removed × 0.18 fallback color dim, raised initial alpha 0.3→1.0, unclamped color from 0.5→1.0 max

- **Swarm**: wider orbit radius 0.3→0.5; reduced radial damping 8.0→4.5; stronger beat orbit expansion
- **Flux**: sparkle system (8% of particles get 2.5x brightness with flicker); opacity curve for gentle fade-out; raised background cap 0.5→0.8

## v1.2.1 — 2026-03-05

### Audio
- Add WASAPI loopback capture for Windows — auto-captures desktop audio (what's playing through speakers) without requiring Stereo Mix
- WASAPI backend uses `windows` crate COM APIs: `IMMDeviceEnumerator` → `IAudioClient` (loopback) → `IAudioCaptureClient`
- Same fallback pattern as Linux: try WASAPI loopback first, fall back to cpal input devices
- Supports float32, int16, and int24 formats with stereo→mono downmix
- Device friendly name shown in status bar (e.g. "Speakers (Realtek Audio)")

### Bug Fixes
- Fix webcam "Failed to fulfill requested format" on Windows: cameras that only support raw formats (YUYV/NV12) now work via automatic fallback from MJPEG to any supported format

### CI
- Upload debug build artifacts on PRs for all platforms

## v1.2.0 — 2026-02-28

### GPU Particle System
- GPU-driven pipeline: counter buffer, indirect draw, alive/dead index lists — zero dead particle processing
- `particle_lib.wgsl` auto-prepended to all compute shaders: shared structs, bindings, hash/rand, emit/alive helpers
- Alive/dead protocol: atomic emission claims, compact alive index rendering
- 3D curl noise flow field: 64x64x64 baked texture at `@group(1)`, `sample_flow_field()` helper
- Trail rendering: per-particle ring buffer, ribbon triangle strips with tapering width/alpha, separate indirect draw
- Spatial hash grid: 40x40 GPU 3-pass pipeline (count → prefix sum → scatter), neighbor query at `@group(3)`
- ParticleUniforms extended from 128 to 192 bytes (flow field + trail params)
- ParticleRenderUniforms extended from 32 to 48 bytes (frame_index + trail params)
- Particle UI panel: alive/max count with utilization bar, emit rate, burst, lifetime, speed, size, drag sliders, feature badges

### New Effects
- **Flux**: 25K particles following curl noise flow field, audio-reactive flow strength and speed
- **Ribbons**: 8K particles with flow field + 16-point trail ribbons, audio-reactive width/opacity
- **Chaos**: 40K particles tracing Lorenz/Rossler strange attractors with RK4 integration, 3D perspective projection, audio-reactive bifurcation parameters
- **Helix**: 15K charged particles spiraling via Lorentz force F=q(E+v×B), positive/negative charges, audio-reactive B_z and E fields
- **Murmuration**: 60K flocking particles with Vicsek model, spatial hash neighbor query, audio-reactive order↔disorder phase transition
- **Cymatics**: 30K particles forming Chladni nodal line patterns via gradient descent, audio frequency bands select mode numbers
- **Coral**: 40K particles tracing Turing-like organic growth patterns, hexagonal spots morphing to labyrinthine stripes

### Bug Fixes
- Fix Murmuration crash: create spatial hash before compute pipeline so shader bindings validate at pipeline creation
- Fix particle size exponential blowout in all 6 new effects: size calculation read back previous frame's computed size (`p.vel_size.w`), compounding scale factors >1.0 each frame causing particles to grow until they fill the screen. Fix stores initial size in `pos_life.z` and uses that as base instead of the accumulated value
- Tune bloom thresholds (0.70–0.85), reduce particle counts (4K–10K), lower feedback decay, add hard caps to bg shaders
- Fix all 6 new effects washing out to uniform brightness: reduce particle counts 3-8x (into 4K-10K working range), raise bloom thresholds to 0.70-0.85, lower bloom intensity to 0.30-0.35, reduce HDR clamp from 1.5 to 1.0 in bg shaders, lower alpha multiplier from 2.0 to 1.5, restore per-particle brightness/alpha to visible levels, reduce feedback decay for faster trail fade
- Fix Chaos visibility: increase projection zoom 50% so attractor shape fills screen instead of concentrating in a small region
- Fix Helix vertical bands: widen emission spread and add oscillating horizontal E-field to create interweaving spirals
- Tune all new effects: lower trail_decay defaults to 0.78-0.80, reduce particle counts and emit rates
