## v0.3.11 — 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Async preset loading** — presets with media/video layers decode in a background thread, keeping current content playing; atomic swap on completion with pulsing status bar indicator and preset button highlight
- Generation-based cancellation for rapid MIDI preset cycling (only final preset applies)

### Fixed
- **Webcam layer preset ordering** — loading a preset with a webcam layer no longer appends it to the end of the stack; webcam content is now placed in-place at its correct index, preventing extra stray layers and layer count growth on repeated save/load cycles
- **Webcam decode panic hardening** — backoff (50ms sleep) after corrupted frame decode panics to avoid hammering a broken camera; auto-stop capture thread after 10 consecutive panics with user-visible error log
- Log GPU present mode and available modes on startup for easier driver issue diagnosis
- **Clippy `never_loop` lint** — replace `while`+`break` with `match` drain-and-retry in preset loader, unblocking CI for v0.3.11 release

## v0.3.10 — 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Three new particle effects** — Veil (flowing silk curtain with displacement field physics), Nova (fireworks with burst emission and gravity), Vortex (black hole with 1/r² orbital mechanics, accretion disk, and polar jets)
- **Keyboard hints in status bar** — "D toggle overlay · F fullscreen" shown when overlay is hidden
- **Auto-show panels** — overlay panels fade in with 2s delay + 1s alpha fade on first launch, bypassed by manual toggle
- BPM convergence tests at 90/120/140/170/200/230 BPM with extracted `run_bpm_convergence_test` helper

### Changed
- Rename Settings panel to Global
- Replace CVD themes (Deuteranopia/Protanopia/Tritanopia) with visually distinct VJ themes (Midnight/Ember/Neon)
- **Tune Veil effect** — higher particle density (750 emit rate), larger sizes, boosted brightness, softer vignette, fold-boost alpha for richer fabric appearance

### Fixes
- Show actual dlopen error messages in NDI diagnostics panel (exposes quarantine, signature, and architecture mismatch issues); upgrade failed-path logging to `warn` level; add macOS troubleshooting tips for quarantine removal and ad-hoc signing
- Fix Storm lightning flashes clustering on left/top-left — replace sin-based hash (degrades at large float32 inputs) with fract-based `phosphor_hash2` using decorrelated seeds
- **Fix macOS NDI library validation error** — add `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement so Hardened Runtime signed builds can dlopen NDI dylib (signed by Vizrt with different Team ID); update NDI panel troubleshooting tips

## v0.3.8 — 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Webcam input layers** — live camera feed as a compositing layer (`--features webcam`), cross-platform via nokhwa (v4l2/AVFoundation/MediaFoundation)
  - Capture thread with bounded channel, automatic frame drain (latest-only)
  - "+ Webcam" button in layer panel, webcam controls panel (device name, resolution, mirror, disconnect)
  - Preset save/load with webcam device reconnection
- `ParticleSystem::set_compute_shader()` and `clear_customization()` for runtime particle shader management (infrastructure for future particle design system)
- **Combined "All Media" file filter** — media file picker defaults to showing all supported types (images + video) when video feature is enabled

### Changed
- **Image scatter shader** — spring-damper physics with hardcoded constants, random scatter direction on beat, skip transparent particles, remove audio color shift (preserve original image colors)
- CI: add `libclang-dev` dependency, clippy/test/build steps for `webcam` feature, release builds include `webcam` feature

### Fixes
- Fix NDI runtime discovery on macOS — remove non-existent versioned dylib names, skip `exists()` check (works around NDI 6.0.0 installer permissions bug), add `/opt/homebrew/lib` + `NDI_RUNTIME_DIR_V6`/`V5` env vars, show searched paths in UI when not found
- **Webcam robustness** — validate camera access before spawning capture thread (user-friendly EBUSY error), catch libjpeg panics on corrupted MJPEG frames (skip frame instead of dying), detect dead capture threads with status bar notification, clean up capture when deleting webcam layers

## v0.3.6 — 2026-02-27

### Fixes
- Fix PulseAudio capture delivering audio only ~2x/sec (set explicit fragsize=4096, was using PA default ~88KB)
- Runtime-load PulseAudio via dlopen — release binaries no longer crash on systems without libpulse installed
- Truncate long audio device names in UI to prevent panel width blowout

### Added
- `--audio-test` CLI flag: standalone audio diagnostic (no GPU, works over SSH)
- Periodic audio health logging (reads/s, latency stats, throughput) every 5s
- `PHOSPHOR_AUDIO_DEBUG=1` env var for per-read verbose logging
- `AudioSystem::Drop` for clean thread shutdown on exit

### Changed
- Skip cpal device enumeration when PulseAudio is active (eliminates JACK "cannot connect" noise)
- CI no longer requires `libpulse-dev` build dependency

## v0.3.5 — 2026-02-27

### Fixes
- Use PulseAudio capture on Linux (bypasses ALSA, fixes audio not working in release binaries on PipeWire systems)
- Fall back to cpal/ALSA if PulseAudio unavailable

## v0.3.4 — 2026-02-27

### Fixes
- Auto-retry audio stream on PipeWire when callbacks stall (synchronous retry — insufficient)

## v0.3.3 — 2026-02-27

### Fixes
- Rebuild release binaries with clean CI cache (fixes audio callbacks not firing in CI-built binaries)
- Suppress noisy ALSA/JACK/OSS stderr messages on Linux during device enumeration
- Overhaul blend modes: replace SoftLight with ColorDodge, HardLight, Exclusion, Subtract

## v0.3.2 — 2026-02-26

### Fixes
- Fix audio not working on Linux with PipeWire (upgrade cpal to 0.17.3 — fixes ALSA start threshold)
- Add audio health monitoring: detect and warn when device opens but callbacks never fire
- Add diagnostic logging for first audio callback (visible with `RUST_LOG=phosphor_app=info`)

## v0.3.1 — 2026-02-26

### Fixes
- Audio not working in release (CI-built) binaries on macOS and Linux
- macOS: add audio-input entitlement for hardened runtime codesigning
- Linux: filter device list to only usable devices (removes raw ALSA entries)
- Device switch race condition: join old audio thread before opening new device
- Show actual error message on audio capture failure

## v0.3.0 — 2026-02-26

### New Features
- In-app WGSL shader editor with live hot-reload
- Audio input device selector with runtime switching and persistence
- Built-in/user sections in effects panel with delete and copy-shader
- NDI® luma-to-alpha toggle for downstream compositing
- Per-effect shader alpha for NDI compositing transparency

### Improvements
- macOS app icon and polished DMG installer with drag-to-Applications
- Shader editor UI refinements (transparent background, vector icons, minimize/expand)
- NDI feature enabled in release builds
- Hide default Phosphor effect from UI, reduce particle count

### Testing
- 236 new unit tests across 27+ modules (coverage 11% → 13%)

### Fixes
- Clippy approx_constant warnings
- Auto-release CI when Cargo.toml version changes

## v0.2.0

Initial public release with multi-layer composition, GPU particles, audio-reactive
shaders, MIDI/OSC input, web control surface, preset system, media layers, video
playback, and NDI® output.
