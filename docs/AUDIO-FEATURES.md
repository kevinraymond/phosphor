# Fosfora Audio Features

What Fosfora hears in your music, in plain English — and the research behind each measurement.

Fosfora listens to your audio and turns it into 74 numbers, updated 86 times a second. Every one of those numbers is available to every shader, every parameter slider, and every OSC client. This page explains what each one actually means musically, and links the paper or standard it comes from.

## How to Read This Page

**Every value runs 0 to 1** unless the entry says otherwise. That means you can wire any feature to any slider without doing math first.

**The name in `code font` is the real name.** It is exactly what you type in a shader, exactly what you see in the binding matrix, and exactly what goes out over OSC. There is no translation layer.

**Every entry ends with a `Source:` line.** Most point at the paper or standard the implementation follows. Some say *Fosfora-specific* — that means we made it up, there is no paper, and we would rather tell you than invent a citation. A few say *Ported from EASEy-GLYPH*, an earlier project of ours.

**The numbers level themselves automatically.** Quiet music still fills the 0–1 range, and loud music does not peg everything at 1. If a feature is behaving in a way that surprises you, [How the Numbers Are Tamed](#how-the-numbers-are-tamed) explains why.

## Loudness and Level

### Frequency bands

**`sub_bass` `bass` `low_mid` `mid` `upper_mid` `presence` `brilliance`** — how much energy sits in each slice of the frequency range, from the lowest rumble to the highest sparkle. These are the workhorses: seven sliders that between them describe the whole shape of the sound. Wire `sub_bass` to scale, `presence` to sparkle, and you have a reactive visual in two minutes.

| Band | Range | Typical content |
|---|---|---|
| `sub_bass` | 20–60 Hz | Sub-bass rumble, kick drum fundamental |
| `bass` | 60–250 Hz | Bass guitar, kick body |
| `low_mid` | 250–500 Hz | Low vocals, warmth |
| `mid` | 500–2000 Hz | Vocals, guitars, snare |
| `upper_mid` | 2000–4000 Hz | Vocal clarity, guitar bite |
| `presence` | 4000–6000 Hz | Hi-hats, cymbal shimmer |
| `brilliance` | 6000+ Hz | Air, sparkle |

Source: Fosfora-specific — the band edges are a conventional seven-way split, but the measurement is ours: each band is read from whichever of three FFT sizes best resolves it, and the top three get a gentle tilt so cymbals are not permanently dwarfed by bass. See [`audio/analyzer.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/audio/analyzer.rs).

**`rms`** — the plain, unweighted loudness of the signal. It is the simplest possible "how much sound is there" number, and it responds instantly. Reach for `loudness_m` instead when you want something that matches how loud the music *feels*; use `rms` when you want raw and fast.

Source: Standard descriptor — [librosa's `rms`](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.feature.rms.html) documents the same root-mean-square measurement.

**`loudness_m`** — how loud the music actually sounds to a person, measured over the last 0.4 seconds. This is the same meter broadcasters and streaming services use, so it weighs frequencies the way your ears do instead of just counting signal. Prefer it over `rms` whenever you want an "intensity" that behaves the same across different tracks and different sound cards.

Source: [ITU-R BS.1770](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.1770/en) and [EBU R 128](https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/r/r128.pdf) — K-weighting plus a 400 ms sliding window, mapped from −60..0 LUFS onto 0..1. Fosfora measures a mono downmix and skips the BS.1770 gating, which applies only to whole-programme measurement.

**`loudness_s`** — the same perceptual loudness, but averaged over 3 seconds instead of 0.4. It ignores individual hits and tracks the overall level of the section you are in. Use it for slow background changes that should not twitch on every snare.

Source: [ITU-R BS.1770](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.1770/en) — the short-term window from the same standard.

**`loudness_trend`** — is the track getting louder? It rises when the recent level pulls ahead of the longer average, which is exactly what happens through a build-up, and sits at 0 the rest of the time. It is the cleanest single "something is coming" signal Fosfora produces.

Source: Fosfora-specific — the rising difference between the momentary and short-term loudness, in [`audio/loudness.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/audio/loudness.rs). It also feeds `buildup`.

---

## Spectral Shape

These six describe the *character* of the sound rather than its loudness. They are what you want when the visual should change with the texture of the music, not its volume.

Each links to librosa's documentation, which defines the same formula in readable, runnable form. For the formal definitions, all six are specified in [Peeters (2004)](http://recherche.ircam.fr/anasyn/peeters/ARTICLES/Peeters_2003_cuidadoaudiofeatures.pdf) — see [Further Reading](#further-reading).

**`centroid`** — how bright the music sounds. It tracks where the weight of the sound sits: muffled, bass-heavy material reads near 0, while hi-hats, strings and cymbals pull it toward 1. This is the best default for driving hue, color temperature, or anything that should look brighter when the music gets brighter.

Source: Standard descriptor — [librosa's `spectral_centroid`](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.feature.spectral_centroid.html) documents the same measurement. Fosfora averages on a musical (octave-based) axis rather than a raw Hz one, so moving up an octave always shifts it by the same amount.

**`flux`** — how fast the sound is changing. A steady held chord reads near 0; a busy passage with notes and hits constantly arriving reads high. It is deliberately built to ignore volume, so turning the music up does not make it rise.

Source: [Dixon, *Onset Detection Revisited*, DAFx-06](https://www.dafx.de/paper-archive/2006/papers/p_133.pdf) §2.1 defines the spectral flux measure. See also [Bello et al., *A Tutorial on Onset Detection in Music Signals* (2005)](https://hajim.rochester.edu/ece/sites/zduan/teaching/ece472/reading/Bello_2005.pdf).

**`flatness`** — how noisy versus musical the sound is. A held synth pad, a bass note, or a sung vowel reads near 0; a snare, a cymbal wash, or vinyl crackle reads near 1. Good for driving grain, static, or anything that should get dirty when the music does.

Source: Standard descriptor — [spectral flatness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_flatness), also known as Wiener entropy. Fosfora measures it across [mel bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_scale) rather than raw frequency bins, which tracks perception more closely.

**`rolloff`** — where the top of the sound ends. It marks the point below which almost all the energy lives, so it rises when a filter opens up or hi-hats come in, and drops when a track gets muffled. The classic pairing is a filter-sweep visual that opens as this rises.

Source: Standard descriptor — [librosa's `spectral_rolloff`](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.feature.spectral_rolloff.html) documents the same formula. Fosfora uses the conventional 85% threshold.

**`bandwidth`** — how spread out the sound is. A single clean note or a lone sine tone reads low; a full mix, a distorted guitar, or a crash cymbal spreads energy everywhere and reads high. Pair it with `centroid`: that one says *where* the sound sits, this one says *how wide* it is around that point.

Source: Standard descriptor — [librosa's `spectral_bandwidth`](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.feature.spectral_bandwidth.html) documents the same formula.

**`zcr`** — a rough, very cheap noisiness meter. It counts how often the waveform crosses zero, which is high for hissy and percussive sounds and low for smooth bass. It largely agrees with `flatness`, but reacts faster and costs nothing.

Source: Standard descriptor — [librosa's `zero_crossing_rate`](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.feature.zero_crossing_rate.html) documents the same measurement.

---

## Rhythm, Beats and Tempo

**`kick`** — the kick drum, and nothing else. It listens only between 30 and 120 Hz and reports the moment energy arrives there, so a hi-hat or vocal cannot trigger it. When you want a visual that thumps with the kick specifically rather than with any drum, this is the one.

Source: Fosfora-specific — a narrow-band version of the same level-independent measure `onset` uses, with its own automatic gain so it stays usable across tracks. See [`audio/analyzer.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/audio/analyzer.rs).

**`onset`** — something just got hit. It spikes the instant a new sound starts — a kick, a snare, a plucked string, a vocal entry — and falls back toward 0 between hits. Unlike `beat`, it does not care about tempo, so it fires on every attack including the off-beat ones.

Source: [Böck & Widmer, *Maximum Filter Vibrato Suppression for Onset Detection*, DAFx-13](https://www.dafx.de/paper-archive/2013/papers/09.dafx2013_submission_12.pdf) — the SuperFlux algorithm. Its frequency maximum filter is why a vibrato or a wobble bass no longer registers as a stream of false hits.

**`beat`** — the metronome. It is 1 for a single frame on each beat and 0 the rest of the time, following the tempo Fosfora has locked onto rather than every individual hit. Because it predicts as well as listens, it keeps ticking through a breakdown where nothing is actually being struck.

Source: Ported from [EASEy-GLYPH](https://github.com/kevinraymond/easey-glyph) — a predict-and-confirm scheduler that fires on a confirmed hit inside a short window around the expected beat, and fires anyway when a predicted beat is missed.

**`beat_phase`** — where you are between beats, as a smooth ramp from 0 to 1. This is usually more useful than `beat` itself: instead of a single-frame flash you get a continuous value to drive a swing, a bounce, or a rotation that stays locked to the groove. Feed it through something like `1.0 - phase * phase` for a decaying bounce.

Source: Ported from [EASEy-GLYPH](https://github.com/kevinraymond/easey-glyph) — Fosfora additionally re-runs this ramp on the render thread so it stays smooth at your frame rate rather than the analysis rate.

**`bpm`** — the tempo, divided by 300. Multiply by 300 to get real beats per minute (OSC clients receive the real value already). It settles within a few seconds of a steady groove starting and then holds very still, so it is safe to drive something slow and structural.

Source: Ported from [EASEy-GLYPH](https://github.com/kevinraymond/easey-glyph) — tempo is found by autocorrelating the onset stream ([Wiener–Khinchin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener%E2%80%93Khinchin_theorem)), corrected for half/double-time errors against a tempo prior, then tracked with a [Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter). Background reading: [Ellis, *Beat Tracking by Dynamic Programming* (2007)](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/pubs/Ellis07-beattrack.pdf).

**`beat_strength`** — how confident Fosfora is about the beat it just fired. Low values mean it is guessing through a quiet or ambiguous passage. Use it to fade a beat-driven effect out gracefully instead of having it stutter. Available in shaders and bindings, but not sent over OSC.

Source: Ported from [EASEy-GLYPH](https://github.com/kevinraymond/easey-glyph) — the onset strength captured at the moment the beat fired.

**`downbeat`** — the "one" of the bar. Like `beat`, it is 1 for a single frame, but only on the first beat of each bar, so you can save your biggest visual moves for it. Fosfora works out whether the music is in 3 or 4 and where the bar starts by noticing which beats are consistently more emphatic.

Source: Fosfora-specific — no published algorithm; it scores candidate meters and bar positions by accent contrast over the last 16 beats, in [`audio/downbeat.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/audio/downbeat.rs). Expect roughly 70–80% accuracy on straightforward 4/4 electronic music and less elsewhere.

**`bar_phase`** — where you are in the bar, as a smooth 0 to 1 ramp. It is `beat_phase` one level up: a slow sweep that completes once per bar rather than once per beat, ideal for camera moves or color cycles that should breathe with the music's larger pulse.

Source: Fosfora-specific — the bar-level clock in [`audio/downbeat.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/audio/downbeat.rs).

**`beat_in_bar`** — which beat of the bar you are on, as a number from 0 to 1. In 4/4 it steps through 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75. Use it to do something different on beat 3 than on beat 1. It steps rather than slides, so do not expect smooth motion from it.

Source: Fosfora-specific — the beat counter in [`audio/downbeat.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/audio/downbeat.rs).

## Pitch and Harmony

**`chroma`** (12 values, read with `chroma_val(i)`) — how much of each of the twelve notes is sounding, ignoring which octave. Index 0 is C, 1 is C sharp, and so on up to 11 for B. A held C major chord lights up indices 0, 4 and 7; a bass-heavy drum loop lights up almost nothing.

Source: [Brown, *Calculation of a Constant Q Spectral Transform*, JASA 1991](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Brown91-cqt.pdf) — the [constant-Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant-Q_transform) approach Fosfora's version is built on. See also [librosa's `chroma_cqt`](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.feature.chroma_cqt.html). Fosfora tracks the track's actual tuning reference, so a recording tuned to 432 Hz still lands cleanly on the right notes.

**`dominant_chroma`** — which single note is loudest right now, as an index from 0 to 1. Multiply by 11 to get a pitch class. It jumps rather than slides, which makes it perfect for picking a palette entry and useless for driving smooth motion.

Source: Fosfora-specific — the strongest entry of `chroma`, in [`audio/analyzer.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/audio/analyzer.rs).

**`key_class`** — what key the track is in, as a note index from 0 to 1. Multiply by 11 to get the root (0 is C). Unlike `dominant_chroma`, this looks at roughly the last twelve seconds, so it stays put through individual chord changes and typically holds steady for a whole track.

Source: [Krumhansl & Kessler (1982)](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.89.4.334), *Psychological Review* 89(4) — the listener-derived key profiles Fosfora correlates against (paywalled; record at [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7134332/)).

**`key_is_minor`** — 0 for a major key, 1 for a minor one. It is the single cheapest way to make a visual feel bright or melancholy without any other analysis. It changes rarely, so treat it as a switch rather than a signal.

Source: [Krumhansl & Kessler (1982)](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.89.4.334) — the same profile match, reporting which of the 24 major and minor candidates won.

**`key_confidence`** — how sure Fosfora is about the key. Drum-only or atonal passages drive it down. Gate any key-driven color change on this, or the visual will lurch during the breakdown.

Source: [Krumhansl & Kessler (1982)](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.89.4.334) — the strength of the winning profile match.

**`pitch`** — the note a solo instrument or voice is singing, as a smooth 0 to 1 sweep across five octaves. 0 is a low A at 55 Hz, 1 is the A five octaves up, and every octave is exactly 0.2 apart, so it is easy to map onto anything musical. It tracks one line at a time, so it works on vocals and leads, not full chords.

Source: [de Cheveigné & Kawahara, *YIN, a fundamental frequency estimator for speech and music*, JASA 2002](https://doi.org/10.1121/1.1458024) — the classic pitch tracker ([free full text](https://web.archive.org/web/20260426151005/http://audition.ens.fr/adc/pdf/2002_JASA_YIN.pdf); implementation notes at [librosa's `yin`](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.yin.html)). Fosfora holds the last note through gaps so the visual does not snap to the bottom on every rest.

**`pitch_confidence`** — whether there is actually a note to track. Drums, noise and silence push it to 0. Always gate `pitch` on this; without it, a pitch-driven visual will wander during percussion-only passages.

Source: [de Cheveigné & Kawahara (2002)](https://doi.org/10.1121/1.1458024) ([free full text](https://web.archive.org/web/20260426151005/http://audition.ens.fr/adc/pdf/2002_JASA_YIN.pdf)) — the periodicity measure YIN produces alongside the pitch estimate.

**`pitch_hz`** *(OSC only)* — the same pitch as a real frequency in hertz, for clients that would rather have 440 than 0.6. It is not a shader uniform; it is derived on the way out.

Source: Fosfora-specific — derived from `pitch` in [`osc/sender.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/osc/sender.rs).

---

## Timbre

**`mfcc`** (13 values, read with `mfcc(i)`) — a compact fingerprint of *tone color*. Together these describe what makes a trumpet sound different from a violin playing the same note at the same volume. Individual coefficients do not have tidy names; treat them as thirteen dials that move distinctly for distinct sounds, which makes them excellent for driving anything that should look different for different instruments.

Source: [Davis & Mermelstein (1980)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TASSP.1980.1163420), *IEEE Trans. ASSP* 28(4) — the original mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (paywalled; free walkthrough at [librosa's `mfcc`](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.feature.mfcc.html)).

**`contrast_0` … `contrast_5`** — how peaky the sound is in each of six frequency ranges. High values mean clear notes standing out against a quiet background; low values mean everything in that range is mush. It is a good discriminator between a clean tonal mix and a dense distorted one.

Source: [Jiang et al., *Music type classification by spectral contrast feature*, ICME 2002](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2002.1035731) (paywalled; the same feature is documented at [librosa's `spectral_contrast`](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.feature.spectral_contrast.html)).

**`contrast_mean`** — the average of the six contrast values, as a single "how defined is this mix" dial. Use it when you want the idea without wiring six separate inputs.

Source: [Jiang et al. (2002)](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2002.1035731) — averaged across bands by Fosfora.

**`timbre_flux`** — how fast the tone color is changing. A filter sweep, a vocal entering, or a pad morphing all push it up, while a steady sound sits near 0. Crucially it ignores volume changes, so unlike `flux` it will not fire just because someone rode the fader.

Source: Fosfora-specific — the rate of change of the MFCCs, following the standard delta approach documented at [librosa's `delta`](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.feature.delta.html). See [`audio/timbre.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/audio/timbre.rs).

---

## Stereo Field

**`pan`** — where the sound sits between the speakers. 0 is hard left, 0.5 is centered, 1 is hard right. OSC clients receive this as −1 to 1 instead. Wire it to horizontal position and the visual follows the mix.

Source: Fosfora-specific — a left/right energy balance over roughly the last 46 milliseconds, in [`audio/stereo.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/audio/stereo.rs).

**`stereo_width`** — how wide the mix is. A mono recording reads 0, a normal stereo mix sits in the middle, and heavily spread or phase-tricked material approaches 1. Good for driving how far apart elements sit on screen.

Source: Fosfora-specific — a mid/side energy ratio in [`audio/stereo.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/audio/stereo.rs).

**`stereo_corr`** — how similar the left and right channels are. 1 means identical, 0.5 means unrelated, and 0 means they actively cancel each other. OSC clients receive this as −1 to 1. It is the more technical cousin of `stereo_width`, and it is the one that catches deliberately out-of-phase production tricks.

Source: Fosfora-specific — a Pearson correlation between the channels, in [`audio/stereo.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/audio/stereo.rs).

---

## Drums vs. Instruments

Fosfora separates the sound into hits and held tones, and reports both. This is the group to reach for when you want drums and melody driving *different* parts of the same visual.

**`percussive_energy`** — how much drum there is. Kicks, snares and hi-hats push it up; a sustained pad or held chord leaves it near 0. Route it to anything sharp: strobes, shakes, hard cuts.

Source: [FitzGerald, *Harmonic/Percussive Separation Using Median Filtering*, DAFx-10](https://dafx10.iem.at/papers/DerryFitzGerald_DAFx10_P15.pdf) — Fosfora runs it moment by moment, so it adds no delay.

**`harmonic_energy`** — how much sustained, pitched material there is. Pads, vocals, bass notes and chords push it up; a drum-only passage leaves it near 0. Route it to anything smooth: flowing color, slow drift, glow.

Source: [FitzGerald (2010)](https://dafx10.iem.at/papers/DerryFitzGerald_DAFx10_P15.pdf) — the other half of the same separation.

**`harmonic_ratio`** — is this moment drums or music? 0 means pure percussion, 1 means pure sustained tone, and 0.5 means an even mix. Because it is a balance rather than a level, it stays meaningful whether the track is loud or quiet — ideal for crossfading between a strobe-driven look and a flowing one.

Source: [FitzGerald (2010)](https://dafx10.iem.at/papers/DerryFitzGerald_DAFx10_P15.pdf) — the balance between the two separated energies.

---

## Song Structure

These three look at the track over tens of seconds rather than milliseconds. They are the closest Fosfora gets to understanding the arrangement.

**`section_novelty`** — the track just changed character. It peaks when a song moves into a new part, verse to chorus or breakdown to main section, by noticing that the sound has stopped resembling what came just before. It reports the change about three seconds late, so treat it as a cue to switch looks rather than as a hit.

Source: [Foote, *Automatic Audio Segmentation Using a Measure of Audio Novelty*, ICME 2000](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/workshops/mir2009/references/Foote_00.pdf) — self-similarity novelty with a checkerboard kernel.

**`buildup`** — tension is rising. It climbs through a riser by combining four things producers actually do before a drop: get louder, get brighter, add more hits, and pull the bass out. It is the single best driver for a slow global intensity ramp — a camera push-in, a widening glow, a rising blur.

Source: Fosfora-specific — no published algorithm; a weighted combination of four cues in [`audio/structure.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/audio/structure.rs), tuned for electronic music. The weights are adjustable live in the audio panel.

**`drop`** — the moment the track lands. Fires once, for a single frame, when a long build-up is suddenly answered by a jump in loudness and the bass coming back in. It then refuses to fire again for 16 seconds, so a busy chorus cannot machine-gun it.

Source: Fosfora-specific — no published algorithm; a hand-tuned state machine in [`audio/structure.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/audio/structure.rs), with thresholds exposed in the audio panel.

## Audio Textures

The features above are single numbers. These are whole pictures of the sound, available to shaders as functions rather than uniforms — for oscilloscopes, spectrum bars and waterfalls.

**`waveform(x)`** — the actual shape of the sound wave, for an oscilloscope trace. Give it a horizontal position from 0 to 1 and it returns the lowest and highest the wave reached there. Fosfora aligns the trace to the wave itself, so it sits still on screen instead of skating sideways.

Source: Fosfora-specific — zero-crossing-triggered min/max decimation in [`gpu/audio_textures.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/gpu/audio_textures.rs).

**`spectrum(x)`** — how loud each frequency is right now, for drawing spectrum bars. Position 0 is the lowest frequency and 1 the highest, spaced musically so each octave gets equal width rather than the bass being crushed into the far left.

Source: Fosfora-specific — a log-frequency magnitude texture in [`gpu/audio_textures.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/gpu/audio_textures.rs).

**`spectrogram(uv)`** — the last several seconds of sound as a scrolling image, for waterfall displays. Across is time, with 0 the oldest and 1 the newest; up is frequency. Sample it anywhere to get how loud that frequency was at that moment.

Source: Fosfora-specific — a scrolling [mel-band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_scale) history in [`gpu/audio_textures.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/gpu/audio_textures.rs).

### Binding-only sources

Two extra sets are available in the binding matrix but not as shader uniforms, to keep the uniform budget in check:

- **`audio.mel.0` … `audio.mel.63`** — the 64 individual frequency slices behind `spectrogram`. Use them when seven bands are not enough resolution.
- **`audio.dmfcc.0` … `audio.dmfcc.12`** — the individual rates of change behind `timbre_flux`, as raw plus-or-minus values the binding graph maps for you.

Source: Fosfora-specific — exposed in [`bindings/sources.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/bindings/sources.rs).

---

## How the Numbers Are Tamed

Raw audio measurements are unusable for visuals. A quiet track would barely move anything and a loud one would peg everything at maximum. So every feature passes through three stages before you see it.

### Auto-leveling

Each feature is scaled by one of four policies, chosen per feature:

- **Adaptive** — auto-gain. Watches the last four seconds and stretches what it saw to fill 0–1, so quiet music still drives your visuals. It uses the 5th and 95th percentile rather than the minimum and maximum, so one loud spike cannot flatten everything for the next few seconds. Above the 95th percentile it eases toward 1 instead of clipping, so an unusually big hit still reads as bigger. Used for the seven bands, `rms`, `flux`, `timbre_flux`, and the two separation energies.
- **Fixed range** — already meaningful on its own scale, so it is left alone and simply held steady during silence. Used for `centroid`, `flatness`, `rolloff`, `bandwidth` and `zcr`.
- **Centered** — expressed relative to its own recent average, so 0.5 means "typical" and swings read symmetrically in both directions. Used for the 13 MFCCs.
- **Untouched** — the detector already produced a meaningful 0–1 number and rescaling would only distort it. Used for everything else, including the beat group, key, pitch, stereo and structure features.

The policy for every feature lives in one table in [`audio/schema.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/audio/schema.rs).

### Smoothing

Every feature then gets a fast rise and a slow fall, tuned individually. That is why a kick snaps up instantly but eases back down: instant response in both directions would look like flickering. Triggers such as `beat`, `downbeat` and `drop` skip this entirely, and so do the ramps like `beat_phase`, because smoothing a value that wraps from 1 back to 0 would sweep it backwards through the middle.

### The silence gate

One shared test decides whether there is any music at all: perceptual loudness below −55 LUFS counts as silence. When it trips, energy features fall to 0, the auto-leveling windows freeze so silence cannot rescale them, and values that should persist — tempo, key, pitch — hold their last reading instead of collapsing.

Source: Fosfora-specific — the gate lives in [`audio/loudness.rs`](../crates/phosphor-app/src/audio/loudness.rs) and is shared by every detector.
