"""Generate docs/GALLERY.md from the .pfx files themselves.

The old README claimed 24 effects when there were 38, because the catalogue was maintained by
hand in three different files and quietly fell behind every release. Generating it removes the
opportunity: run this after adding an effect and the gallery is correct by construction.

Effects are grouped the way a user would sort them rather than the way the loader does —
`effect_type` marks several particle simulations as "feedback" because that drives a UI badge,
which is not a useful distinction when you are just browsing for a look.

Usage:
    scripts/gen_gallery.py                    # write docs/GALLERY.md
    scripts/gen_gallery.py --check            # verify it is up to date (exit 1 if not)
    scripts/gen_gallery.py --local            # point tiles at assets/media/tiles instead

Every built-in effect, at **default settings** — no tweaking, no hand-picked parameters. Each
clip is two bars of the same synthesized loop, so they are all reacting to the identical
passage: a build, a moment of near silence, and a drop.

Effects respond to what they hear, so what you see here is a starting point, not a fixed look.
Change the music and they change with it; every parameter is also a slider, and can be driven
by MIDI, OSC, a phone or a webcam.

"""

---

Clips were captured from the running app by [`scripts/capture/`](../scripts/capture), which
drives real playback through the production render pipeline — post-processing and all — rather
than an offscreen approximation.

Two effects are not shown because they are hidden from the browser: **Phosphor**, the signature
intro visual you see at startup, and **Stress**, a ten-million-particle rasterizer benchmark.
