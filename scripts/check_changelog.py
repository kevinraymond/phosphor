"""Guard the CHANGELOG headers the release workflow depends on.

`release.yml` builds the GitHub release body by extracting the section between
`## vX.Y.Z` headers with awk. If the header for the version being tagged is not there —
because it still reads `## Unreleased` — awk matches nothing and the release publishes
with only the static footer. That has now happened twice, for v1.11.0 and again for
v1.13.0, where the already-published header had been reverted to `## Unreleased` with new
entries stacked on top of it.

Checks:
  * the version in crates/phosphor-app/Cargo.toml has a `## vX.Y.Z — date` header with a
    non-empty body, unless that version is already tagged (i.e. already released)
  * every released version still has its header, and still has a body
  * `## Unreleased` appears at most once, and above every released section

Section PROSE is deliberately not checked. The v1.9.0–v1.12.0 entries were rewritten in
place during the docs wave to match the house style, long after they shipped; that is an
edit we want to keep making. Only the header going missing is always a bug.
