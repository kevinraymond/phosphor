# Capture one clip per built-in effect by driving the real Fosfora app.
#
# Why the live app and not an offscreen probe: the `#[ignore]`d GPU probes in the test suite
# are each hardcoded to a single effect and bypass the post-process chain entirely, so their
# output does not look like what a user sees. Filming the running app gives true default
# settings through the production pipeline — bloom, tonemap, vignette, grain and all.
#
# How it stays honest:
#   * Config is ISOLATED via XDG_CONFIG_HOME, so the app starts from stock defaults and the
#     run cannot read or write the operator's real presets, bindings or settings.
#   * Audio is routed by MOVING the app's own capture stream onto a private null sink. The
#     system default sink is never touched — someone is usually working at this machine.
#   * The loop is played once through `-stream_loop -1`, so playback never drifts, and each
#     effect is filmed over exactly one loop pass. Every clip therefore covers the identical
#     musical passage (groove -> buildup -> gap -> drop), which is what makes the gallery a
#     fair comparison instead of a lottery over whichever bar happened to be playing.
#     That phase lock is load-bearing and easy to lose: see the scheduling note further down —
#     a fixed per-effect sleep CANNOT hold it, and when it slipped, clips silently landed on
#     different parts of the music and late ones missed the drop altogether.
#
# Effect order is deterministic: `EffectLoader::scan_effects_directory` sorts by .pfx filename
# and cycling skips `hidden` effects. The app boots on Phosphor (hidden), so the first
# next_effect lands on visible[1], not visible[0] — hence the wrap at the end.
#
# `--only` films a named subset without paying for the other 32. The ring is still walked in
# full — the wrap index above is load-bearing and shrinking it mislabels every clip — but an
# unwanted effect is stepped past immediately instead of costing a whole loop pass, so six
# effects take six passes (~4 min) rather than thirty-eight (~25 min).
#
# Usage:  scripts/capture/capture.sh [-o OUTDIR] [--only SLUG,SLUG] [--effects N] [--dry-run]
