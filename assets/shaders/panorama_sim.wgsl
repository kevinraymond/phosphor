// Panorama particle simulation — the stereo field as a picture (#1801)
//
// Sound has a POSITION. The screen is a map of the mix: the horizontal axis is
// the stereo image (left edge = hard left, centre = centre) and the vertical
// axis is frequency, sub-bass at the bottom through cymbal shimmer at the top.
// Each band emits its particles at its OWN measured pan, so a kick sits as a
// dot dead centre while hats and reverb tails fan out to the edges — and a
// mono mix collapses the whole picture into a single vertical column.
//
// This is the first consumer of A13b per-band pan (band_pan(i)) and of
// pan/stereo_width/stereo_corr in a particle sim at all — those three have
// existed in the fragment path since A13 (#1464) but the particle ABI carried
// no stereo until the #1801 bump.
//
// The three stereo features drive three separate behaviours, so you can read
// which one is moving:
//   band_pan(i)   -> WHERE each band's particles are born (the image itself)
//   stereo_width  -> how far they fan out from that point (mono = a column)
//   stereo_corr   -> coherence. Correlated content rides tight parallel lanes;
//                    decorrelated content scatters into a cloud.
//
// NO TRAIL RING: this sim never calls trail_write, and the .pfx sets
// trail_length 0. Those two must agree — particle_lib declares trail_buffer at
// @group(2) @binding(0) and the system only creates that bind-group layout when
// trail_length >= 2 (system.rs), so a sim that references trail_write while its
// .pfx says 0 fails compute-pipeline validation every frame and renders nothing.
// --- Param mapping ---
// param(0) = spread        (fan width scale)
// param(1) = band_gap      (0 = whole spectrum on one goniometer row, 1 = full ladder)
// param(2) = drift         (motion speed)
// param(3) = scatter       (how much decorrelation disperses)
// param(4) = hue           (palette anchor offset)
// param(5) = glow          (brightness gain)
// param(6) = centre_pull   (bg shader: vignette toward the centre line)
// param(7) = trail_decay   (bg shader: feedback decay)
